CHEVRON CORPORATION 1993 ANNUAL REPORT


	Chevron has significant oil and gas exploration and production operations in Nigeria and in the
Angolan exclave of Cabinda, where its share of net production is about 100,000 barrels of crude oil
per day from each of these countries.  Angola has experienced civil unrest following its 1992 elections;
separately, elements seeking independence of Cabinda from Angola have periodically created civil
unrest in the area of the company's operations.  Also, the nullification of the Nigerian elections in
1993 has been followed by a period of political uncertainty.  To date, none of these events has had a
significant impact on the company's operations, but the company is closely monitoring developments.

Environmental matters.  Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages
are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.
These regulatory requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity and govern not
only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells.  Most of
the costs of complying with myriad laws and regulations pertaining to its operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of conducting its business.  Using definitions and guidelines estab-
lished by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimates its worldwide environmental spend-
ing in 1993 was nearly $1.5 billion, of which $675 million were capital expenditures.  These amounts
do not include non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation programs, but include
spending charged against such reserves.
	In addition to the various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing
its ongoing operations and products, the company (as well as other companies engaged in the petro-
leum or chemicals industries) is required to incur expenses for corrective actions at various facilities
and waste disposal sites.  An obligation to take remedial action may be incurred as a result of the enact-
ment  of laws, such as the federal Superfund law, or the issuance of new regulations or as the result of
accidental leaks and spills in the ordinary course of business.  In addition, an obligation may arise when
a facility is closed or sold.  Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and
sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable under
regulations existing at the time performed, but now will require investigatory and/or remedial work
to ensure adequate protection to the environment.
	During 1993, the company recorded $215 million of before-tax provisions to provide for envi-
ronmental remediation efforts, including Superfund sites.  Actual expenditures charged against these
provisions and other previously established reserves amounted to $183 million in 1993.  At year-end
1993, the company's environmental remediation reserve was $746 million, including $56 million
related to Superfund sites.  Receivables of $18 million have been recorded for expected reimburse-
ments of expenditures for environmental cleanup.
	Under provisions of the Superfund law, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as
certain state agencies, have designated Chevron a potentially responsible party (PRP) for remediation
of a portion of 223 hazardous waste sites.  At year-end 1993, the company's cumulative share of costs
and settlements for approximately 145 of these sites, for which payments or provisions have been
made in 1993 and prior years, was about $89 million, including a provision of $6 million during 1993.
For the remaining sites, investigations are not yet at a stage where the company is able to quantify a
probable liability or determine a range of possible exposure.  The Superfund law provides for joint
and several liability.  Any future actions by the EPA and other regulatory agencies to require Chevron
to assume other responsible parties' costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have
a material effect on the company's consolidated financial position or liquidity.
	Provisions are recorded for work at identified sites where an assessment or remediation plan has
been developed and for which costs can reasonably be estimated.  It is likely the company will con-
tinue to incur additional charges for environmental programs relating to past operations.  These
future costs are indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contam-
ination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the deter-
mination of the company's liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which
such costs are recoverable from insurance or other sources.  While the amounts of future costs may be
material to the company's results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, the com-
pany does not expect these costs to have a material effect on Chevron's consolidated financial position
or liquidity.  Also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had or
will have any significant impact on the company's competitive position relative to other domestic or

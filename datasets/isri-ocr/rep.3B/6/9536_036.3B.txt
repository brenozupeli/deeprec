Notes (continued)


earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in
these companies.
  Under insurance tax laws in effect for years prior to
1984, a portion of Franklin's accumulated statutory
income has not been subject to tax.  Should the aggre-
gated untaxed income exceed certain prescribed maxi-
mums or cash dividends to the Company exceed the
accumulated taxed portion, the excess would be subject
to federal income tax.  Taxes of $70 million calculated
using the current federal statutory income tax rate have
not been provided on the untaxed income, which aggre-
gated $201 million at December 31, 1993, since Franklin
does not contemplate distributing such income in the
foreseeable future.

Earnings Per Share

  Earnings per Common share are based on the weighted
average number of Common shares outstanding in each
year and after preferred stock dividend requirements.
  Fully diluted earnings per Common share assume that
any convertible debentures and convertible preferred
shares outstanding at the beginning of each year or at
their date of issuance, if later, were converted at those
dates, with related interest, preferred stock dividend
requirements and outstanding Common shares adjusted
accordingly.  It also assumes that outstanding Common
shares were increased by shares issuable upon exercise of
those stock options for which market price exceeds exer-
cise price, less shares which could have been purchased by
the Company with related proceeds.

  ACQUISITIONS

  During the fourth quarter of 1993, Whyte & Mackay
completed its acquisition of Invergordon Distillers
Group PLC ("Invergordon") by purchasing the remain-
ing 58.7% of the outstanding shares of Invergordon for a
cost, including fees and expenses, of $343.6 million.  In
1991, Whyte & Mackay acquired 41.3% of the outstand-
ing shares of Invergordon for a cost, including fees and
expenses, of $255.5 million.  Due to absence of control,
this was recorded in "Other assets" as an investment in
marketable equity securities at a carrying value of $222.2
million at December 31, 1992.  The aggregate cost of
Invergordon of $599.1 million, exceeded the fair value of
net assets acquired by $492.9 million.  The financial state-
ments for prior periods were not restated because the
effect was not material.  Operations, including the effect


of the application of the equity method to prior periods,
were consolidated from December 1, 1993.  Had opera-
tions been consolidated from January 1, 1992, they would
not have materially affected the periods being reported.
In connection with the acquisition of Invergordon, liabil-
ities amounting to $108.4 million were recorded at date of
acquisition.
  On June 30, 1993, The American Tobacco Company
acquired from B.A.T Industries, PLC the Benson and
Hedges cigarette trademark in Europe in exchange for
assignment of its Lucky Strike and Pall Mall overseas
cigarette trademarks, and $107.2 million in cash, includ-
ing expenses, and contingent future payments based on
volumes.  Results from the Benson and Hedges trademark
are included in international tobacco from the date of
acquisition.  A pretax gain of $25.5 million was recog-
nized in domestic tobacco as a result of the assignment of
the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall trademarks.  Certain of the
contingent payments are guaranteed and, accordingly,
their present value is included in the initial $183 million of
intangibles that have been recorded.  Any payments in
excess of the guarantees will also be amortized over
periods not to exceed 40 years.
  On December 13, 1991, Jim Beam Brands Co.
acquired certain distilled spirits trademarks for an aggre-
gate cost, including fees and expenses, of $376.2 million.
Results from these trademarks were included in opera-
tions from January 1, 1992.

  The Company's accounts receivable comprises
amounts due from customers, principally in the tobacco
products segment.  At December 31, 1993 and 1992,
approximately 45% and 42% of accounts receivable were
related to U.K. operations, and 6% and 5% were due
from a U.K. tobacco distributor, respectively.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT


The consolidated financial statements and other financial 
information of Deere & Company in this report were prepared 
by management, which is responsible for their contents. They 
reflect amounts based upon management's best estimates and 
informed judgments. In management's opinion, the financial
statements present fairly the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the company in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.
  The company maintains a system of internal accounting 
controls and procedures which is intended, consistent with
reasonable cost, to provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are executed as authorized, that they are included in the financial
records in all material respects, and that accountability for assets is
maintained. The accounting controls and procedures are supported 
by careful selection and training of personnel, examinations by 
an internal auditing department and a continuing management
commitment to the integrity of the system.
  The financial statements have been audited to the extent
required by generally accepted auditing standards by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, independent auditors. The independent auditors have
evaluated the company's internal control structure and performed 
tests of procedures and accounting records in connection with the 
issuance of their report on the fairness of the financial statements.
  The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Review
Committee composed entirely of directors who are not employees
of the company. The Audit Review Committee meets with 
representatives of management, the internal auditing department
and the independent auditors, both separately and jointly. The 
Committee discusses with the independent auditors and approves
in advance the scope of the audit, reviews with the independent
auditors the financial statements and their audit report, 
consults with the internal audit staff and reviews management's
administration of the system of internal accounting controls.
The Committee reports to the Board on its activities and findings.


INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


Deloitte &
Touche LLP


Deere & Company:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Deere & Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1994 and
1993 and the related statements of consolidated income and of
consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 1994. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and signifi-
cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Deere & Company and subsidiaries at October 31, 1994 and 1993
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended October 31, 1994 in confor-
mity with generally accepted accounting principles.
  As discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, effective November 1, 1992 the company changed
its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other 
than pensions.

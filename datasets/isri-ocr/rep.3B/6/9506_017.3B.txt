CHEVRON CORPORATION 1993 ANNUAL REPORT


the West, Southwest and South.  At year-
end, Chevron had 2,415 company-owned
or -leased service stations, down from ap-
proximately 3,400 in 1988.  Branded outlets
that sell Chevron gasoline have declined by
about 2,600 to 5,925.  In the same 1988 to
1993 period, the sales volume of Chevron
gasoline increased 5 percent.

Stations cut costs, speed service.

Computer technology is cutting credit
card operating costs, increasing employee
productivity and reducing overhead.  For
example, about 1,300 Chevron stations -~
up from 900 in 1992 -~ now offer Fast Pay.
This is part of an automated, satellite-
linked system that approves transactions
in approximately five seconds and allows
customers to pay at the pump, without the
need for an attendant.  The system reduces
potential losses from fraud, speeds payment
to Chevron and helps station operators
better manage their businesses.

Consumers give Chevron high rating.

An independent survey of gasoline buyers
asked if they were "very satisfied" with
their last purchase, would definitely buy
that brand again and would recommend it
to others.  Chevron's rating was 25 percent
higher than the industry average.   The sur-
vey showed that customers appreciate
Chevron's consistency of service, product
performance, station cleanliness, personal
attention and competitive prices.

Research supports refining and prod-
uct advances.  Chevron Research and
Technology Company (CRTC) provides
services to other Chevron operating com-
panies throughout the world.  CRTC has
improved refining processes and devel-


oped fuels and lubrication oils to meet
U.S. environmental requirements.  Its re-
search also led to the 1993 introduction of
a new Delo 400 Motor Oil.


International products business now
markets technology.  Chevron Interna-
tional Oil Company (CIOC) is primarily
involved in international crude and prod-
ucts sales and trading.  It also now manages
a growth market for Chevron's proprietary
technologies for fuels, lubricants and cata-
lysts.  In 1993, a number of these technol-
ogies were licensed for projects in Japan,
Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea and Canada, as
well as in the United States.  In early 1994,
CIOC agreed to license technology and
provide engineering services for a major
refinery-modification project near St.
Petersburg, Russia.

3.2 billion pounds a year.  The plant also
increased capacity for propylene, a feed-
stock for polypropylene plastics.  As
building-block chemicals, olefins are
vital to Phillips' chain of integration -~
the ability to upgrade the value of raw
materials.

Aromatics:  Aromatics and cyclics results
benefited in 1993 from higher sales vol-
umes and reduced feedstock costs.  This
helped offset lower sales prices for
cyclohexane (a feedstock for nylon) and
paraxylene (a feedstock for polyester).
Aromatics are produced at Borger,
Sweeny and Puerto Rico, and are sold to
outside customers.  Phillips is the world's
leading cyclohexane producer, with 70
percent of U.S. capacity and 14 percent
worldwide.

Specialties:  The specialty chemicals
business remained a steady income pro-
ducer in 1993, thanks to higher sales vol-
umes for sulfur chemicals produced at
the Borger, Texas, and Tessenderlo,
Belgium, plants.
  At Tessenderlo, production of poly-
sulfides (used in lubricant additives)
began in 1993, opening the door to new
markets.  In the U.S., sales were higher
for Borger-produced isobutylbenzene, a
feedstock for the pain reliever ibuprofen.
Sales were also up for oil field chemicals
manufactured at Phillips' Conroe, Texas,
plant.  This was mainly due to increased
exploration and production activity in the
Gulf of Mexico.

Polyethylene/Polypropylene:  Although
sales volumes for polyethylene were up
for the year, overcapacity in the market
kept prices and margins low.  Results for
polypropylene were down, compared
with 1992, due to a major renovation of
manufacturing facilities at HCC, which
limited production.

Pipe Operations:  Phillips Driscopipe,
Inc. achieved record sales volumes and
brought in higher earnings for the year.
Driscopipe, based in Richardson, Texas,
is the nation's largest supplier of poly-
ethylene pipe.  Sales of gas distribution
pipe brought in the highest margins, and
sales were up for water and sewer lines.
Driscopipe also introduced a new prod-


uct -~ Opticore -~ during the year.  Used
for water and sewer applications,
Opticore is unique in that it is white on
the inside (rather than black), allowing
customers to check the condition of the
buried pipe with fiber-optic cameras.

K-Resin: Thanks to higher sales in 1993,
K-Resin was the top earnings producer
in the plastics line and set a new produc-
tion record.  This tough, clear plastic is
used to make products such as toys, dis-
posable cups and shower doors.  Recent
product improvements are opening new
markets for K-Resin, such as food and
medical packaging.

Engineering Plastics:  Stronger demand
and new applications for Ryton engineer-
ing plastics pushed sales higher in 1993.
Overcapacity in the market, however,
lowered prices and margins.  Ryton's
1993 results were lower than the year
before, mainly because 1992 earnings
benefited from an asset sale.  Ryton


(polyphenylene sulfide) is the brand
name for Phillips' high-performance,
heat- and chemical-resistant resins and
compounds.  Ryton is used to manufac-
ture electrical or electronic components
and under-the-hood automotive parts.

New Products Expand Plastics Market
Phillips is working to develop new prod-
ucts and processes -~ or upgrade exist-
ing ones -~ to bring in higher margins.
The company completed development of
new high-flow injection molding resins
in 1993, aimed at the thin-walled con-
tainer market.  Because these resins have
very low odor and taste, they work well
for food packaging, such as margarine
tubs, yogurt containers and plastic cups.
The company is also evaluating an
improved HDPE blow molding resin
used to make containers for household
and industrial chemicals, such as bleach
and detergent.


K-Resin, a clear, shatter-resistant plastic produced by Phillips, is well-suited for manufacturing food con-
tainers.  McDonald's restaurants use cups made of recyclable K-Resin for their frozen yogurt sundaes -~ a
big hit at this birthday party.

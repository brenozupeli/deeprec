CHEVRON CORPORATION 1993 ANNUAL REPORT


STRATEGIC INTENT

Grow Caltex
in attractive markets

Caltex Petroleum Corporation is well posi-
tioned in the Asia-Pacific region, where
product demand currently is increasing at
three times the U.S. and world average.  At
present, there is a 1.5-million-barrel-a-day
shortfall in refining capacity in the area, and
it is expected to continue at least through
1998.  To meet the rising demand, Caltex-~
Chevron's 50 percent-owned refining and
marketing affiliate -~ plans to invest nearly
three-quarters of its budget in these high-
growth areas, largely to enhance its refining
capability.

Caltex adds refining capacity.  Caltex
currently holds interests in 14 refineries.
In a joint venture with the government,
Caltex is building a 130,000-barrel-a-day
refinery in Thailand, which has the most
rapidly expanding fuel-demand rate in the
region.  Gasoline demand is growing at
nearly 12 percent annually, while overall
product demand is expanding almost 9
percent a year.
	Caltex is upgrading its 50 percent-
owned, 380,000-barrel-a-day Korean
refinery, the largest in the Caltex system,
and a 220,000-barrel-a-day Singapore
refinery in which it holds a one-third in-
terest.  The Singapore upgrading project,
the largest refinery investment project in
the country's history, will increase refining
capacity by 60,000 barrels a day.  Both proj-
ects are scheduled for completion in 1995.


	Refinery investments also will increase
the yield of higher-value products and clean
fuels to meet the changing product mix and
environmental needs of the region.

Retail sales continue strong.  Robust
marketing margins contributed to higher
1993 earnings.  Over the next five years, it is
estimated that Caltex's product sales will
grow about 5 percent a year.  Caltex also is
focusing on strategies to improve the profit-
ability of its retail marketing business.  Cur-
rently, Caltex supplies 17,500 retail outlets.

Company moves into new countries.
Caltex is considering major investments in
China, where demand for petroleum prod-
ucts is expected to increase by more than
1 million barrels a day by 1998.  In addition,
Caltex has re-entered the market in India
and plans to open offices in Vietnam and
other high-growth areas.

STRATEGIC INTENT

Exploit
competitive strengths
in chemicals

Chevron Chemical Company's 1993 earn-
ings continued at depressed levels, reflect-
ing an industrywide condition caused by
weak demand and industry overcapacity.
Although a gradual recovery is expected,
the company is taking aggressive steps to 
reduce operating costs by approximately
$100 million annually by 1996.  Chevron
Chemical will eliminate about 475 jobs,
most from operations that will be sold or

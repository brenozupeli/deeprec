The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 106 and 109 during the 1992 fourth quarter, retroactive to January 1, 1992.  Accordingly, certain
prior 1992 financial information has been restated.  Quarterly per share amounts associated with the accounting changes do not add to the year 1992 because the annual
effect was recalculated on the average shares outstanding for the entire year.

recorded.  The Company also recorded charges of $29.4 million ($21.3 million after tax or $.15 per share) for the estimated cost of closing its Madisonville, KY, specialty
tire plant and to write down the assets of its Paracrevea  rubber plantation in Latin America.
   During the fourth quarter, the Company sold its polyester business assets.  A gain of $130.2 million ($75.9 million after tax or $.53 per share) was recorded.  The

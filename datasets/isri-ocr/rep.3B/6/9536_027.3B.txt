  During the year, the Company issued $150 million of
7~~~% Debentures, Due 2023.  The net proceeds from this
issuance was used for general corporate purposes, includ-
ing the repayment of outstanding debt.  During 1993,
~75 million of 9~~~% Notes and $20 million in Medium
Term Notes matured.
  At December 31, 1993, the Company had $850 million
of debt securities (including Medium Term Notes) avail-
able for sale under its shelf registration with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
  At year end, the Company had $4 billion of long-term
credit facilities, of which $3.8 billion remained unused.
These facilities are available for general corporate pur-
poses, including acquisitions and support of the Com-
pany's short-term borrowings in the commercial paper
market.  In addition, Gallaher has committed short-term
revolving  credit agreements of ~300 million (approxi-
mately $444 million) which are available for general cor-
porate purposes, including acquisitions.
  The Company believes that its internally generated
funds, together with its access to global credit markets,
are more than adequate to meet its capital needs.
  Working capital decreased from $664.4 million in 1992
to $575.4 million in 1993.  Management believes this is an
adequate level to support continued growth.
  Life insurance net assets were $1.3 billion, up $69.8
million.  Although life insurance net assets and cash flow
are consolidated in the financial statements, generally
Franklin is restricted by the insurance laws of the State of
Illinois as to amounts that can be transferred to the Com-
pany in the form of dividends, loans or advances without
approval of the Director of Insurance.  This restriction has
not had and is not expected to have a material effect on
the ability of the Company to meet its cash obligations.
  Life insurance investments in 1993 increased by $487.6 
million primarily reflecting increases in fixed maturities
and mortgage loans.
  At December 31, 1993, the unrealized gain on
Franklin's held-to-maturity portfolio was $467.1 million.
  In 1993, independent insurance analysts continued to
rate Franklin highly in terms of financial strength.
Franklin has consistently followed a conservative invest-
ment program and has maintained a high-quality port-
folio.  At year-end, only 4.5% of Franklin's held-to-
maturity portfolio was in non-investment grade
securities.  Its mortgage loans represented 9.2% of its
investment portfolio, and its non-performing assets com-
prised less than 1%.


  Franklin's insurance and investment-type contracts
contain provisions that permit surrender for cash.  At
December 31, 1993, outstanding contracts representing
approximately 22% of the liabilities for these products
provided for withdrawal fees, which may discourage
early surrender.  During 1993, contracts representing less
than 4% of these liabilities were surrendered prior to
maturity.  Such surrenders are a part of the normal course
of business and do not reflect any significant change in
surrender activity.

  FOREIGN EXCHANGE

  The Company has sizeable investments in, and derives
substantial income from, Europe (primarily the United
Kingdom).  Therefore, changes in the value of foreign
currencies, principally sterling, can have a significant
effect on its financial statements when translated into
dollars.

  TAXES

  Federal excise taxes on cigarettes increased four cents
per pack on January 1, 1993.  In 1993, U.K. taxes on
cigarettes increased 12%.  Total domestic and interna-
tional excise taxes were $5.4 billion and income taxes
amounted to $407.9 million.  Including Social Security
and other taxes, the Company's total taxes amounted to
$6 billion, as compared with $6.5 billion in 1992.

  COMMON STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

  Common stockholders' equity at year end was
$4.3 billion.  Equity remained flat primarily resulting
from the charge to net income due to the adoption of the
FAS Statements and the purchase of 1.1 million shares for
the treasury, offset by results from operations net of divi-
dends to stockholders.  In 1993, Common stockholders'
equity also reflected a decrease of $56.5 million due to
foreign currency translation adjustments.
  Return on average Common stockholders' equity was
11.1% as compared to 20.3% in 1992.  Excluding the
impact of the one-time charge due to the adoption of the
FAS Statements, the return on equity would have been
15.2%.

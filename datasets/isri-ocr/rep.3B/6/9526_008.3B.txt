Exploration & Production


  Exploration and Production's business strategy is based on several key goals.
  First, E&P is working to increase the value of its assets by adding oil and
  natural gas reserves over the long term at competitive costs. Improving
profitability through stronger cash flow and continuing to improve on E&P's strong
safety and environmental performance are also "fundamental to increasing
shareholder value -~ a commitment we have made at Phillips," says John Whitmire,
E&P executive vice president.
  "Our future depends on how well we manage our business," Whitmire says.  "What
we're after is a value-oriented approach in everything we do.  Our goal is not simply to
find oil and natural gas ... it's to find and develop these resources in a way that
generates significant value over the long term."


Focus on Value Makes
A Difference for E&P


Earnings Increase
Net income increased 5 percent, to $386
million, in 1993.  The increase was mainly
due to higher U.S. natural gas sales prices
and gains from asset sales, along with
lower worldwide production costs and
depreciation charges.  Partly offsetting
these positive trends were lower crude oil
sales prices and volumes, and foreign cur-
rency losses, versus gains a year ago.

Capital Expenditures Higher
Capital expenditures were up significantly
in 1993 -~ to $819 million versus $583
million  in 1992 -~ as work began on sev-
eral important developments scheduled to
begin production in the mid-1990s.  These
include development of the Judy/Joanne
fields in the United Kingdom (U.K.)
North Sea and the Xijiang project off-
shore China, among others.  E&P capital
expenditures (representing nearly 70 per-
cent of Phillips' total) included two new
tankers for the company's liquefied natur-
al gas (LNG) operations in Kenai, Alaska.
These tankers were subsequently sold
during the year and leased back to
Phillips.

Emphasis on Value, Reserves Growth
E&P's four operating divisions -~ North
America, Norway, U.K. and International
-~ are pursuing value in project selection
and at each stage of the exploration and
production cycle.  Says Whitmire: "We


are making new discoveries and accelerat-
ing development efforts.  As a result, our
projects are becoming profitable sooner."
  Phillips is also working to achieve
stronger performance from existing
assets, focusing on those that offer strong
profit margins, growth potential or strate-
gic positioning.  "If an asset is not adding
value, we'll sell it or trade it for one that
will -~ increasing the value of Phillips'
holdings," Whitmire says.

Several Assets Sold
Several non-strategic E&P assets were
sold in 1993, including Phillips' interest
in the Harriet field, offshore western
Australia; the Kakap field in Indonesia;
the Waalwijk gas field in the Netherlands;
production operations in western Egypt;
and properties in North America.  For the
year, proceeds from asset sales (excluding
the LNG tankers) totaled $176 million.

Reserves Replacement Strong
Technology continues to play an impor-
tant role in replacing reserves -~ helping
Phillips increase oil and natural gas
recovery from mature fields and identify
reserves in complex geological structures.
Phillips replaced 104 percent of its world-
wide production on a barrel-of-oil-equiva-
lent (BOE) basis in 1993, and 147 percent
of U.S. production.  Over the last five


Total reserves advanced
for the sixth time in seven
years, moving up a frac-
tion, to 2.048 billion bar-
rels-equivalent.  A 4 per-
cent gain in natural gas
more than offset slippage
in crude oil (2 percent)
and gas liquids (10 per-
cent).  U.S. gas reserves
rose a healthy 13 percent;
foreign oil reserves crept
up slightly.

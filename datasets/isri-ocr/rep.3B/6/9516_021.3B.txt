Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and Subsidiaries


  The net effect of gains on asset sales, workforce reduction expenses, plant
closure costs and asset writedowns increased general products operating income
by $9.1 million in 1993, $161.1 million in 1992 and $17.9 million in 1991.

Oil Transportation

Sales of $61.9 million, $60.9 million and $30.9 million were recorded for 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively.  Sales for this segment consist of tariffs charged by
the All American Pipeline System (the System) and revenues, net of acquisition
costs, resulting from various crude oil gathering, purchasing and selling activi-
ties.  Acquisition costs associated with these activities amounted to approxi-
mately $655 million in 1993, $809 million in 1992 and $1.1 billion in 1991.
Increased third party oil shipments through the System resulted in a lower level
of crude oil purchasing and selling activities in 1993.  Approximately 185,000
barrels per day, on average, of onshore California, Alaska North Slope and Outer
Continental Shelf (OCS) crude oil were transported through the System in 1993,
compared to 164,000 barrels in 1992 and 117,000 barrels in 1991.
  The operating loss of $11.6 million in 1993 decreased from operating losses
of $15.8 million in 1992 and $52.1 million in 1991.  The improvement resulted pri-
marily from increased throughput in the System and reduced expenses resulting
from cost containment programs.
  During 1993, producers of offshore California crude oil entered into long
term throughput agreements for the transportation of crude oil through a por-
tion of the System beginning in 1994.  These contracts are not expected to have
a material impact on this segment's operating results in 1994.

Geographic Segments

U.S. Operations

Sales for 1993 of $6.8 billion decreased slightly from 1992 but increased
8.8 percent from 1991.  Operating income for 1993 of $590.5 million decreased
9.8 percent from $654.3 million in 1992 but increased 39.7 percent from $422.7
million in 1991.
  Sales decreased in 1993 due primarily to the absence of the divested
General products businesses.  Sales and operating income in 1993 were favorably
impacted by increased unit sales of tires and other automotive products, produc-


tion efficiencies resulting from a high rate of capacity utilization, reduced selling,
administrative and general expenses and improved results in oil transportation
activities.  Results in 1992 reflect higher tire unit sales due primarily to growth
in the replacement market and improved market share resulting from expanded
distribution channels and new product introductions.
 The net effect of gains on asset sales, workforce reduction expenses, plant
closure costs and asset writedowns increased U.S. operating income by $12.2
million in 1993, $120.4 million in 1992 and $13.5 million in 1991.

International Operations

Sales for 1993 of $4.9 billion decreased 2.6 percent from 1992 but increased
4.1 percent from 1991.  Operating income for 1993 of $574.6 million increased
25.1 percent from $459.2 million in 1992 and 59.3 percent from $360.7 million
in 1991.
  In Europe, sales in 1993 decreased due primarily to the strengthening of the
U.S. dollar versus various European currencies and slightly lower tire unit sales,
but operating income was higher due to lower costs and a shift in mix towards
higher margin replacement tires.  Replacement tire unit volume improved from
1992, although original equipment tire unit volume decreased significantly due
to the recession in the region. Sales and operating income in 1992 increased due
to improved pricing, higher tire unit sales, lower raw material costs and the effect
of changing exchange rates.
  In Latin America, sales and operating income in 1993 increased due primarily 
to improvements in Brazil, where results reflect increased demand within the
country and in exports and improved margins.  Tire unit sales in the region
increased slightly, and operating income also improved due to improved margins
resulting from production efficiencies associated with increased capacity utiliza-
tion and the effects of cost containment measures.  Sales in 1992 increased on
higher volume, but operating income in that year was lower due primarily to the
writedown of the assets of a rubber plantation.
  In Asia, sales and operating income in 1993 decreased despite slightly higher
tire unit volume, due in part to a shift in sales mix toward lower margin original
equipment tires, increased competitive pressures and the effect of currency
translations.  Sales in 1992 increased due to higher volume and improved pricing,
although operating income was lower.

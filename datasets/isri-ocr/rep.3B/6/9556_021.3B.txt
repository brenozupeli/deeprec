MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Subsidiaries


Management believes that the following commentary
and tables appropriately discuss and analyze the com-
parative results of operations and the financial condition
of the Corporation for the periods covered.

1992 Restructuring and Accounting Changes
The comparability of income statement data is affected 
by the following items that occurred in 1992:
~ The Corporation announced a restructuring plan to 
strengthen its competitive position in consumer and
service products operations in Europe and certain 
operations in North America. The plan included
eliminating approximately 800 positions, principally in 
Europe; restructuring manufacturing facilities at
Rouen, France, and Larkfield, England; discontinuing 
diaper production at mills in Fullerton, Calif., and 
Memphis, Tenn.; writing off the No. 2 newsprint
machine at the Coosa Pines, Ala., mill; and integrating 
certain U.S. and Canadian consumer and service prod-
ucts operations. Additional information concerning 
events and decisions which gave rise to the restructur-
ing plan is presented in Note 9 to the Financial
Statements.

The $250.0 million pretax cost of the restructuring was
charged to 1992 operating profit. The restructuring 
charge decreased 1992 product class and geographic 
operating profit as follows:


($ Millions)
North Outside
Restructuring Charge America North America Total
Class I ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ $(133.1) $(83.1) $(216.2)
Class II~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (21.5) - (21.5)
Class III ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  (8.2) - (8.2)
$(162.8) $(83.1) (245.9)
Unallocated ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (4.1)
Total~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  $(250.0)


The restructuring reduced 1992 net income by $172.0
million, or $1.07 per share.

For the purposes of this Management's Discussion and
Analysis, the 1992 restructuring charge has been 
segregated in the product class and geographic presen-
tations to facilitate a meaningful discussion of ongoing 
operations. For a summary of the product class and
geographic data including the restructuring charge, see
Note 12 to the Financial Statements.


~ New required accounting rules were adopted for post-
retirement health care and life insurance benefits and
for income taxes. These rules resulted in a one-time 
"catch-up" charge of $210.0 million, or $1.31 per 
share, against 1992 net income. These changes had 
no effect on cash flow. See Notes 2 and 3 to the Finan-
cial Statements.

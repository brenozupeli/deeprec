comparisons will improve as the year progresses and that
full year results for 1994 will approximate 1993's result.
  In addition to the previously discussed increases in U.S.
and U.K. tobacco excise taxes, the Clinton administra-
tion has proposed increasing the tax on cigarettes from 24
cents to 99 cents per pack.  Legislation has also been intro-
duced in the U.S. Congress that would increase excise
taxes on cigarettes.  The effects of any of the foregoing
cannot be determined but will likely add to the overall
industry declines and the shift to lower priced brands.  In
addition, further restrictions on advertising and use of
tobacco products in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere are
possible.  A change in timing of the U.K. budget resulted
in a second budget announcement on November 30,
1993, and thereafter will be at about the same time each
year.  This change had the effect of drawing significant
sales into the fourth quarter of 1993 from the first quarter
of 1994.  As a result, the first quarter 1994 comparison
will be especially difficult as 1993's first quarter benefited
from trade buying in anticipation of the March U.K.
budget increase.
  Recent legislation restricts the use of imported tobacco
in U.S. manufactured cigarettes.  Based on the prelimi-
nary rules issued, the impact of this legislation may
increase American Tobacco's 1994 manufacturing cost by
an estimated $10 million.

1992 compared to 1991

  Revenues increased 1% and operating income increased
2%.  Worldwide cigarette unit sales decreased 3.8%.
  International tobacco revenues in sterling increased
slightly as price increases, which principally resulted
from higher U.K. tobacco taxes, line extensions and new
products were largely offset by a 10.9% decline in U.K.
cigarette unit sales.  The U.K. industry declined 6.7%.
Export sales increased principally on shipments of ciga-
rettes to markets in the C.I.S.  The U.K. budgets,
announced in March 1992 and March 1991, each provided
for an increase in taxes on tobacco products with the
result that the tax on a pack of cigarettes increased 13
pence and 22 pence, respectively.  The decline in unit sales
reflected the continuing impact of price increases, includ-
ing the effect of substantial excise tax increases, which,
combined with the prolonged recession, reduced industry
volumes and led to greater price competition and
increased trading down by consumers to lower priced
brands.  These changes particularly affected Gallaher, the
majority of whose sales are in the premium sector.
Despite the decline in unit sales, Gallaher maintained its


position as the #1 tobacco company in the U.K. with an
estimated 41.5% cigarette market share for 1992, com-
pared to 43.5% in 1991.  Operating income in sterling was
up 6% on higher gross margin, favorable comparison to
the 1991 provision for workforce reductions and lower
expenses.  Dollar revenues and operating income percent-
age changes approximated the sterling results.
  Record domestic tobacco revenues increased 3% on
price increases and unit gains in price-value brands,
resulting from product introductions and exports, partly
offset by substantial unit declines in premium brands.
American Tobacco's U.S. unit sales were down 4.3%,
while industry unit sales declined slightly, and market
share for the year was 6.76% compared to 7.03% for
1991.  Price-value brands accounted for 45% of American
Tobacco's U.S. unit sales, compared with 38% in 1991.
Operating income declined 1% on substantially higher
promotional expenses to meet competitive activity and
less favorable product mix, almost offset by price increase
benefits and reductions in coupon redemption accruals.

     DISTILLED SPIRITS

1993 compared to 1992

  Revenues decreased 6% while record operating income
in 1993 rose 10%.
  Beam's revenues were down 5% on lower domestic
volume principally reflecting competitive pricing pres-
sures, the effect of lower foreign exchange rates and a
domestic bulk sale last year.  U.S. distilled spirits con-
sumption continued its long-term decline.  Worldwide
branded case sales were down 1.7% and domestic
branded cases declined 4.6%.  Record operating income
was up slightly on the timing of operating expenses and
higher margins, partly offset by higher international sell-
ing costs.  With recent heavy price competition and con-
sumer rebates, margins may well be under pressure as the
intensifying competitive situation may limit future price
increases.
  Whyte & Mackay revenues in sterling were up 6% on
inclusion of Invergordon for one month and higher vol-
ume, mainly in export markets, partly offset by 1992's
significant level of bulk sales.  Excluding Invergordon,
worldwide case sales were up 10.4% and U.K. case sales
were up 6.5%.  Translated at substantially lower average
foreign exchange rates, revenues were down 9% in dol-
lars.  Operating income in sterling and dollars was up

Operating income              $244    271     157


The decrease in operating income for 1993 resulted from lower
crude oil sales prices and volumes, lower natural gas production,
and higher exploration expenses, primarily from dry hole charges
for wells drilled on the Sunfish, Kuvlum and Wild Weasel
prospects in Alaska.  Partially offsetting these negative factors
were 19 percent higher natural gas sales prices.
  U.S. crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 1993,
compared with 1992, primarily due to normal declines in produc-
tion from mature fields.  The decline in crude production was
partly offset by increased production from the Point Arguello
field, offshore California.
  The increase in operating income from 1991 to 1992 was pri-
marily due to higher natural gas sales prices, lower exploration
expenses and lifting costs, and tax credits for producing fuel from
a nonconventional source related to the company's San Juan
Basin natural gas production.  These positive factors were partly
offset by lower sales prices for crude oil and liquefied natural gas.
  Special items in 1993 included a $5 million after-tax refund of
windfall profit taxes.  The $11 million in special items in 1992
included after-tax asset-sale gains of $19 million, which were
more than offset by a natural gas imbalance accrual adjustment


and other charges.  The special item in 1991 was an after-tax
$164 million writedown of the company's offshore California
properties.

Foreign

Less special items      39     28     49
Operating income      $ 97     81    182


Operating income increased for 1993, compared with 1992,
because of lower lifting costs and exploration expenses, partially
offset by lower crude oil and natural gas sales prices and vol-
umes.  Lifting costs were lower in 1993 partly due to a stronger
dollar against the kroner in the company's Norwegian opera-
tions.  Exploration expenses were lower primarily due to lower
dry hole expenses in Canada, Norway and other foreign coun-
tries.
  Foreign crude oil production was down in 1993, compared
with 1992, primarily because of the sale of producing properties
in Indonesia and Australia, as well as lower production in the
United Kingdom sector of the North Sea.  Partially offsetting the
production decline was the 1993 start-up of Embla field produc-
tion in the Ekofisk area.
  Natural gas production was down in 1993, due mainly to
lower demand.  The lower output was partially offset by higher
production in the United Kingdom, aided by the Ann gas field,
which came on stream in October 1993.
  The decrease in operating income from 1991 to 1992 resulted
from lower sales prices for crude oil and natural gas, along with
a decline in crude oil sales volumes.  Crude oil production was
down in 1992, compared with 1991, due to lower production in
Indonesia and the United Kingdom, coupled with the sale of pro-
ducing properties in Argentina late in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Natural gas production was up in 1992, compared with 1991, pri-
marily from higher production in Norway.
  Special items in 1993 included after-tax asset-sale gains of
$26 million, while special items in 1992 included after-tax for-
eign currency gains of $30 million.  Special items in 1991
included after-tax asset-sale gains of $78 million, partially offset
by after-tax foreign currency losses of $29 million.

The company's Gas and Gas Liquids (G&GL) operations are
conducted primarily through GPM Gas Corporation (GPM), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips Gas Company.  In December
1992, Phillips Gas Company issued preferred stock, and the
effect of the preferred dividend requirements has been excluded
in determining operating income.  Sales statistics are:

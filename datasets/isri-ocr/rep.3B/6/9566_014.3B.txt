HIGHLIGHTS


  Our government avionics business 
won an initial $11 million U.S. Army
contract for ARC-220 high frequency 
radios with production options that
would expand total contract value
to $150 million. The ARC-220s will
go into approximately 3,000 Army
helicopters.
  Production orders totaling $47
million for approximately 27,000 
Precision Lightweight GPS Receivers
(PLGR) were received from the U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD) and
international customers. During the


year we delivered the 20,000th PLGR 
produced under the DoD contract. U.S. 
production alone could total nearly 
94,000 units if all options are exercised.
  Other awards include a $44 
million DoD contract for production of 
ARC-210 Army/Navy/Marine radios, a 
$21 million pact to upgrade avionics 
on German C-160 cargo aircraft, a $17 
million contract for transceivers for
Gulfstream IV/V aircraft, and a $16 mil-
lion contract to upgrade avionics on 
Canadian C-130 aircraft.


~~~ Rockwell Telecommunications


Our Telecommunications business had 
record sales and earnings in fiscal 1994,
a performance driven by continued 
strong demand for high-speed data
modems. This business supplies 
facsimile and data modems and other
advanced semiconductor devices to 
process, transmit and receive all types
of information. We provide approxi-
mately 80 percent of all facsimile
modems and 60 percent of personal
computer data modems worldwide.


  The year was highlighted by
major investments in expansion of
facilities and new product introduction.
  An $150 million expansion of our
Newport Beach, California facility,
primarily for volume manufacture of 
eight-inch submicron wafers, neared
completion at year-end. Eight-inch 
wafers represent the current state-of-
the-art for volume production of 
silicon-based semiconductor devices.
  In 1994, we executed an agree-


ment to acquire additional eight-inch
wafer capacity through a minority
equity investment in Chartered 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte.
Ltd., Singapore.
  We continued development of 
products to meet the information pro-
cessing needs of the future.
  In February, 1994, faced with 
delay in establishment of an industry
standard for faster communications
devices, we introduced our V.Fast Class
data/fax modem which served as a 
"bridging" product until a new modem
standard was ratified. Operating at
28,800 bits-per-second, twice as fast as

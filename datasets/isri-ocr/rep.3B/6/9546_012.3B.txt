Let's also look at growth as a historical
matter.
  In the John Deere industrial 
equipment division, the classic story
goes like this: the oldest son inherited 
the farm, so his younger brother
decided to go into contracting -~
drainage work, land-clearing,
excavation for footings and utilities -~
starting with a small dozer, a backhoe,
perhaps later a four-wheel-drive
loader for site preparation work and
basement excavations; eventually,
an excavator.
  This "owner-operator" contractor
started out small, found his niche, and
built his business on firm footings, in 
relation to demand and flexible enough
to move within the available market.
  Doug McMaster (at right, in 
black jacket) is just such a man. He 
started out in 1981 with a John Deere 
310A backhoe and built his company,
Masco, Inc., into one of the largest 
underground water and sewer 
contracting companies in the Boise,
Idaho, area; annual contract volume
now runs about $6.5 million. The 
company today owns 19 machines -~
all but two are John Deere.
  John Deere's industrial equipment 
division has developed in parallel with
customers like Doug McMaster. Our
product line has grown with customers'
needs, but the primary products are
still the mainstays of any earthmoving 
contractor's fleet. This style of operation
-~ understanding and responding
to customers' needs -~ has been the 
John Deere way from the beginning.
  An important part of growth is
learning how to grow. We've been 
learning continuously for 157 years.
We've found that the one-on-one 
treatment that has always made 
sense to farmers and contractors 
also makes sense to lawn care 
professionals and homeowners, to 
public agencies, to OEMs who
specify John Deere engines for their
own products, and to clients of our
insurance, credit, and managed health
care services.

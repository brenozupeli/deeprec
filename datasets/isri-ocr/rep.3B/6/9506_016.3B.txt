CHEVRON CORPORATION 1993 ANNUAL REPORT


STRATEGIC INTENT

Reshape the
U.S. refining and 
marketing company
into a top
competitor

Chevron U.S.A. Products Company is
strengthening its competitive position by
investing in core refineries, reducing the
size of its refining system and concentrat-
ing on specific marketing regions.

	The company continues to reduce op-
erating costs, which have dropped nearly
$1.00 a barrel since 1991.  In 1993, these
cost cuts, combined with strong gasoline
markets and falling crude oil prices, led to
an earnings increase of 59 percent (exclud-
ing restructuring charges and other special
items totaling $725 million).


Chevron aggressively invests in re-
formulated fuels.  Chevron will invest
nearly $1 billion in its Richmond and El
Segundo, Calif., refineries to produce re-
formulated gasoline.  The new fuel will meet
mandated federal and California standards
to improve air quality.  In addition, a $300
million investment at Richmond will im-
prove refinery efficiency and product yields.

Refinery sales are key part of restruc-
turing.  In view of the California refinery
investments and a need to continue reduc-
ing costs, Chevron is selling its refineries
in Philadelphia and Port Arthur, Texas.
Although profitable and located in a good
market, the Philadelphia Refinery no longer
fits Chevron's system, particularly since
the company does not market gasoline in
the Northeast.  Likewise, the Port Arthur
Refinery no longer fits the company's
strategic focus.

Salt Lake Refinery is well positioned
for diesel market.  A new $40 million
plant at the Salt Lake City, Utah, refinery
is one of the few in the area that economi-
cally manufactures ultra-low-sulfur
diesel fuel.

El Paso operations grow stronger.
Chevron combined its El Paso, Texas,
refinery operations with those of a neigh-
boring refinery to create a top competitor.
As operator, Chevron has integrated the
most efficient units at each refinery to lower
costs and increase yields.

Marketing fine-tunes target areas.
Chevron continues to adjust the geo-
graphic concentration of its service sta-
tions in order to focus resources in areas
where the company is most competitive
and has a strong market share -~ primarily


U.S. Refinery Capacity
Thousands of Barrels Per Day


Expected sales of two refineries in
1994 will reduce refining capacity
about 350,000 barrels per day.


About 1,300 Chevron
stations now offer Fast
Pay, part of a system
that speeds customer
transactions and helps
station operators better
manage their businesses.

Chemicals


M


ost of Phillips' major chemicals lines were profitable in 1993.  However,
  low prices and margins for plastics continued to take a toll on
  Chemicals' earnings.  To overcome the difficult plastics market, Phillips'


Plastics division is pursuing aggressive cost-reduction plans, increasing product sales
and prices, and becoming more involved in high-margin markets.
  Looking at operations, the Houston Chemical Complex (HCC) dramatically
improved polyethylene production and quality, and the customer base continues to
grow.  "As we implement our plans, and market supply and demand come into better
balance, we expect Plastics to become a good income producer over the next few
years," says Dave Tippeconnic, downstream executive vice president.  In Phillips' other
chemicals lines, Tippeconnic sees continued strong performance and solid growth
potential as the global economy gains strength.


  Chemicals Battles
Tough Plastics Market


Earnings Move Higher
Net income rose 83 percent in 1993, to
$75 million.  The increase was mainly
due to the sale of Phillips' fibers opera-
tions and improved ethylene margins.
These items were partly offset by contin-
uing low margins in the polyethylene
line and a writedown associated with the
company's decision to exit the catalyst
business.

Capital Spending Levels Off
After several years of high capital expen-
ditures on new polyethylene facilities at
HCC and a major ethylene unit at the
Sweeny, Texas, facility, spending
declined 35 percent in 1993, to about
$162 million. Expenditures went for a
new catalyst plant (which is being sold),
and several projects at HCC, including a
major upgrade of polypropylene opera-
tions, a new plant water system and con-
struction of an office building.


HDPE Production, Quality Improve
HCC's production of high-density poly-
ethylene (HDPE) was up more than 50
percent in 1993, as sales approached lev-
els that existed before a 1989 accident
destroyed the company's domestic
capacity.
  Polyethylene production at HCC con-
tinued to move toward full capacity (1.8
billion pounds annually) during the first
half of the year. But with low prices and
margins, the decision was made to stabi-
lize production and sales volumes at
about 1.4 billion pounds a year to control
product inventories.  To boost revenues,
Phillips increased its prices for polyeth-
ylene and polypropylene, and the quality
of HDPE was improved.
  In the future, Phillips plans to con-
tinue participating in the fast-growing
Asian market, supplying polyethylene
from HCC and its Singapore facility,
where an expansion will double the

Production of ethylene, a
key ingredient in many plas-
tics, remained at 2.4 billion
pounds.  Worldwide polyeth-
ylene production surged 37
percent, to nearly 1.8 billion
pounds.  The increase was
mainly due to higher
demand and improved oper-
ations at the company's
Houston complex.  Phillips
is one of the world's leading
producers of olefins, such as
ethylene, and polyethylene
plastics.

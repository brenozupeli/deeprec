  Our distilled spirits business
had another strong year, with
operating company contribu-
tion up 13% despite intensified
price competition and a decline
in revenues of 6%.
  Market share improved for
key products in Jim Beam's core
portfolio, although adverse eco-
nomic conditions in many
world markets continued to
depress demand and U.S. con-
sumption continued its long-
term decline.
  The company's flagship
Jim Beam bourbon, #1 in the
world, further strengthened its
leadership position with world-
wide sales of nearly 5 million
cases.  In the U.S., Booker's and
other small batch bourbons
achieved further growth.


  Kessler again increased its
share of the American blended
whiskey market, while
DeKuyper retained its position
as the nation's #1 selling line of
cordials.
  Jim Beam Brands is the sec-
ond largest seller of U.S. bot-
tled Canadian whisky with
Windsor Canadian and Lord
Calvert.  Beam has a 28% share
of this category which contin-
ued to outperform spirits in
general.
  Kamora increased unit vol-
ume, strengthening its position
as the #2 imported coffee
liqueur.  Wolfschmidt vodka
increased volume by over 10%.
  Beam's international sales
increased 10%, with volume
increases in all key markets


including Australia, where
Jim Beam is the largest selling
distilled spirit of any type and
has over half the bourbon
market.
  In November, U.K.-based
Whyte & Mackay completed
the acquisition of Invergordon,
propelling the group to the #3
position in the world scotch
whisky business.  Even exclud-
ing any benefits from the acqui-
sition, Whyte & Mackay
achieved a 28% increase in con-
tribution and its share of the
U.K. scotch whisky market
increased to around 15%.
  Vladivar strengthened its
position as the #2 vodka in the
U.K. with a 12.6% increase in
unit volume.

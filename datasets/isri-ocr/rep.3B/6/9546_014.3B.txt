To position ourselves for continued
long-term growth in the lawn and
grounds care equipment business, we
are doing these things: 
  We will continue to offer products
that meet or exceed customer expec-
tations in both quality and value.
  To better focus our resources,
product offerings, and marketing and
distribution practices, we have
reorganized operations into three
strategic business units:

~ Commercial equipment for
professional groundskeepers,
landscapers, and golf course and
sports turf superintendents.

~ Premium lawn and garden
equipment, such as lawn tractors
and riding mowers.

~ Power products including mowers,
trimmers, leaf blowers, edgers, and
other walk-behind and hand-held
products for both homeowners and 
professional groundskeepers.

  This new marketing structure 
recognizes how customers really shop
for what they need: a homeowner who 
wants a string trimmer is more likely 
to go to a hardware store, while the 
professional grounds keeper would
consider nothing less than a servicing
John Deere dealership. Customers differ
in their expectations of the product,
and also in what they expect from 
their relationship with the seller. We are
now organized to accommodate those
expectations.
  Primarily in residential products, we
are developing a much larger customer
base through the new distribution 
channels we have gained by acquiring 
Homelite.
  Our strategy is simply to get the 
right product to the right place in order to
reach the right customers. By this plan,
we intend to realize the sales potential of
every market we enter.

26. Contingencies and Commitments (continued)

    Energy Buyers litigation

  On December 21, 1992, an arbitrator issued an award for approximately $117 million, plus
interest under Ohio law, against USX in Energy Buyers Service Corporation v. USX, a case originally
filed in the District Court of Harris County, Texas.  Such amount was fully accrued as of December 31,
1992.  On December 15, 1993, USX agreed to settle all claims in the case for $95 million and deferred
payments of up to $9 million.

  Pickering litigation

  On November 3, 1992, the United States District Court for the District of Utah Central Division issued
a Memorandum Opinion and Order in Pickering v. USX relating to pension and compensation claims by
approximately 1,900 employees of USX's former Geneva (Utah) Works.  Although the court dismissed a
number of the claims by the plaintiffs, it found that USX had violated the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act by interfering with the accrual of pension benefits of certain employees and amending a benefit
plan to reduce the accrual of future benefits without proper notice to plan participants.  Further proceedings
were held to determine damages and, pending the court's determinations, USX may appeal.  Plaintiffs'
counsel has been reported as estimating plaintiffs' anticipated recovery to be in excess of $100 million.  USX
believes actual damages will be substantially less than plaintiffs' estimates.

  Environmental matters -~

  The U. S. Steel Group is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
environment.  These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and
require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites.  Penalties may
be imposed for noncompliance.  The U. S. Steel Group provides for remediation costs and penalties
when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably
determinable.  Generally, the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or
the commitment to a formal plan of action.  Accrued liabilities for remediation and mine reclamation
totaled $151 million and $142 million at December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992, respectively.  It is
not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be incurred
or the penalties that may be imposed.
  For a number of years, the U. S. Steel Group has made substantial capital expenditures to bring
existing facilities into compliance with various laws relating to the environment.  In 1993 and 1992, such
capital expenditures totaled $53 million and $52 million, respectively.  The U. S. Steel Group anticipates
making additional such expenditures in the future; however, the exact amounts and timing of such
expenditures are uncertain because of the continuing evolution of specific regulatory requirements.

  Guarantees -~

  Guarantees by USX of the liabilities of affiliated entities of the U. S. Steel Group totaled $209
million at December 31, 1993, and $242 million at December 31, 1992.  In the event that any defaults
of guaranteed liabilities occur, USX has access to its interest in the assets of the affiliates to reduce
U. S. Steel Group losses resulting from these guarantees.  As of December 31, 1993, the largest
guarantee for a single affiliate was $96 million.

  Commitments -~

  At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, contract commitments for the U. S. Steel Group's
capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $105 million and $63 million,
respectively.
  USX has entered into a 15-year take-or-pay arrangement which requires the U. S. Steel Group to
accept pulverized coal each month or pay a minimum monthly charge.  In 1993, charges for deliveries
of pulverized coal which began in 1993 totaled $14 million.  In the future, the U. S. Steel Group will be
obligated to make minimum payments of approximately $16 million per year.  If USX elects to
terminate the contract early,  a maximum termination payment of $126 million, which declines over
the duration of the agreement, may be required.
  The U. S. Steel Group is a party to a transportation agreement with Transtar for Great Lakes
shipments of raw materials required by the U. S. Steel Group.  The agreement cannot be canceled until
1999 and requires the U. S. Steel Group to pay, at a minimum, Transtar's annual fixed costs related to
the agreement, including lease/charter costs, depreciation of owned vessels, dry dock fees and other
administrative costs.  Total transportation costs under the agreement were $68 million in 1993 and $66
million in 1992, including fixed costs of $21 million in each year.  The fixed costs are expected to
continue at approximately the same level over the duration of the agreement.

27. Subsequent Event

  On February 2, 1994, USX sold 5,000,000 shares of Steel Stock to the public for net proceeds of $201
million, which will be reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial statements.

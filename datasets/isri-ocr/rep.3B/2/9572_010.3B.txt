area for more than 50 years. In recent years, im-
proved exploration techniques have revealed new oil
and gas resources. In 1993, Unocal completed ex-
tensive 3-D seismic coverage of its oil and gas fields
along the Gulf Coast, yielding new finds in new 
fault blocks and deeper zones.
  Offshore Texas, Unocal development in the 
Brazos Block A-105 has brought new life to a field
that, after 20 years on production, was nearing 
depletion. The field peaked at 19 million cubic feet
of gas per day in 1977. Development in a new, deeper
zone is expected to increase production to 150 mil-
lion cubic feet of gas per day by April 1994. Unocal
is the operator with a 56.25 percent working interest.
  In December 1993, Unocal started production 
from a well on Mobile Block 904 offshore Missis-
sippi. This is the company's first production from 
the Norphlet trend, a prolific deep gas play. At 
22,400 feet, the well is one of the deepest Unocal
has drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. Daily production


averaged 23 million cubic feet of natural gas in Janu-
ary and is expected to increase above 30 million cubic
feet by April 1994. Unocal's interest is 100 percent.
  Nearby Mobile Block 861, brought on stream in 
February 1994, could add 30 million cubic feet per 
day. The company holds a 25 percent interest. Ver-
milion block 328 (50 percent interest), also brought
on stream in February, is expected to produce 24 
million cubic feet per day by June 1994.
  Offshore Louisiana, Unocal has a 50 percent in-
terest in Garden Banks 191, on stream since Novem-
ber 1993 and expected to produce 160 million 
cubic feet of gas per day by October 1994. Unocal 
also holds a 50 percent interest in Garden Banks
189, which achieved peak gas production of 69 mil-
lion cubic feet per day in January 1994.
  Onshore, Unocal logged new gas reserves in 
Fresh Water Bayou in Louisiana in January 1994.
These reserves are in the same deep zone that has 
dramatically boosted gas production in the North 
Fresh Water Bayou field -~ from 4 million cubic 
feet per day in 1985 to 80 million cubic feet per day
in the last quarter of 1993.
  Unocal discovered gas at Felicia Creek in Liberty
County, Texas, in January 1993 and brought a sec-
ond well on stream in December. The field's daily

Success Rate

Unocal drilled 258 oil 
and gas development 
wells in 1993 and suc-
cessfully brought 243 
of them on production.
This high success rate
reflects the focus on   
increasing production
from an extensive in-
ventory of undevel-
oped resources, such
as those in the Brazos 
Block A-105 offshore
Texas (pictured). Ris-
ing production from
Brazos A-105 is ex-
pected to reach 150
million cubic feet of
gas per day by April 
1994.


Mobile Block 904: Offshore Processing for Economical Development

The Gulf of Mexico's deep Norphlet sands offer major natural gas potential. The gas contains
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2), highly corrosive substances that make develop-
ment much more costly. On Mobile Block 904, removing H2S and CO2 offshore greatly improved 
the project's economics. The complex includes a wellhead platform (left), gas processing facilities
(center), and crew quarters for five (right).

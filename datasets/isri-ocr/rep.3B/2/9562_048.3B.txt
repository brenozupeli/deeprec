NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Pfizer Inc and Subsidiary Companies


pending in the Superior Court, Orange County,
California.  More than 100 of these were settled in early
1993.  Trial of the first of the remaining cases, of six
selected for trial, began July 29, 1993.  After trial, but
before verdict, most of the remaining cases as well as
several unfiled claims, involving approximately 250
implantees, were settled.
  In an attempt to resolve all claims alleging anxiety that
properly functioning valves might fracture in the future,
the Company entered into a settlement agreement in
January 1992 in Bowling v. Shiley et al., a case brought in
the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Ohio that establishes a worldwide settlement class
of people with C/C heart valves and their spouses, except
those who elect to exclude themselves.  The settlement
provides for a Consultation Fund of $90 to $140 million
(depending on the number of claims filed) from which
valve recipients who make claims will receive payments
that are intended to cover their cost of consultation with
cardiologists or other health care providers with respect
to their valves.  The settlement agreement establishes a
second fund of at least $75 million to support C/C valve-
related research, including the development of tech-
niques to identify valve recipients who may have
significant risk of fracture, and to cover the unreim-
bursed medical expenses that valve recipients may incur
for certain procedures related to the valves. The
Company's obligation as to coverage of these unreim-
bursed medical expenses is not subject to any dollar
limitation.  Following a hearing on the fairness of the
settlement, it was approved by the court on August 19,
1992.  An appeal of the court's approval of the settlement
was dismissed on December 20, 1993 by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  A motion
for rehearing en banc is currently pending.  It is expected
that most of the costs arising from the Bowling class set-
tlement will be covered by insurance and the proceeds
of the sale of certain product lines of the Shiley busi-
nesses in 1992.
  Of approximately 900 implantees (and spouses of some
of them) who opted out of the Bowling settlement class,
12 currently have cases or claims pending in the Kahn
consolidation in California; 4 have cases or claims pend-
ing outside of California; approximately 675 whose claims
were included in the Kahn consolidation have been set-
tled; approximately 100 have never filed a case or claim;
and approximately 10 have working valve cases pending.
  Several claims relating to elective reoperations of valve
recipients are currently pending.  Some of these claims
relate to elective reoperations covered by the Bowling
class settlement described above, and, therefore, the
claimants are entitled to certain benefits in accordance
with the settlement.  Such claimants, if they irrevocably
waive all of the benefits of the settlement, may pursue
separate litigation to recover damages in spite of the class
settlement.  The Company is defending these claims.
  Generally, the plaintiffs in all of the pending heart
valve litigations discussed above seek money damages.


Based on the experience of the Company in defending
these claims to date, including available insurance and
reserves, the Company is of the opinion that these actions
should not have a material adverse effect on the financial
position or the results of operations of the Company.
  On September 30, 1993, Dairyland Insurance Co.,
a carrier providing excess liability coverage ("excess car-
rier") in the early 1980s, commenced an action in the
California Superior Court in Orange County, seeking
a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated to pro-
vide insurance coverage for Shiley heart valve liability
claims.  On October 8, 1993, Pfizer filed cross-complaints
against Dairyland and filed third-party complaints
against 73 other excess carriers who sold excess liability
policies covering periods from 1978 to 1985, seeking
damages and declaratory judgments that they are oblig-
ated to pay for defense and indemnity to the extent not
paid by other carriers.
  The Company's operations are subject to federal, state
and local environmental laws and regulations.  Under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"
or "Superfund"), the Company has been designated as
a potentially responsible party by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency with respect to certain
waste sites with which the Company may have had direct
or indirect involvement.  Similar designations have been
made by some state environmental agencies under
applicable state superfund laws.  Such designations are
made regardless of the extent of the Company's involve-
ment.  There are also claims that the Company is a
potentially responsible party or participant with respect
to several waste sites in Canada.  Such claims have been
made by the filing of a complaint, the issuance of an
administrative directive or order, or the issuance of a
notice or demand letter.  These claims are in various
stages of administrative or judicial proceedings.  They
include demands for recovery of past governmental costs
and for future investigative or remedial actions.  In many
cases, the dollar amount of the claim is not specified.
In most cases, claims have been asserted against a num-
ber of other entities for the same recovery or other relief
as was asserted against the Company.  The Company is
currently participating in remedial action at a number
of sites under federal, state and local laws.
  To the extent possible with the limited amount of
information available at this time, the Company has evalu-
ated its responsibility for costs and related liability with
respect to the above sites and is of the opinion that the
Company's liability with respect to these sites should not
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
the results of operations of the Company.  In arriving at this
conclusion, the Company has considered, among other
things, the payments that have been made with respect to
the sites in the past; the factors, such as volume and rela-
tive toxicity, ordinarily applied to allocate defense and
remedial costs at such sites; the probable costs to be paid
by the other potentially responsible parties; total projected

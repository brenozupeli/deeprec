There's not enough space -~ nor
could we sustain your interest
-~ if we were to extol the virtues 
of each of our new products.
But talking about two might
make the point of how we pro-
vide customer value.

Toward the end of last year, we
made a significant entry into 
the consumer computer mar-
ketplace. This entry was not 
lightly taken. In so doing, we
had to establish new distribu-
tion channels, new marketing 
programs, get our product 
costs down to rock bottom, 
and produce a world-class new
product line to soar above the 
cluttered, noisy marketplace.

The Compaq Presario brand
did it all in August to a rousing
worldwide reception. The 
Presario's feature-set, bundled 
software, and competitive 
pricing proved to be almost
irresistible to retail buyers.
Most Presario models sold out
in the fourth quarter. With
many of our retailer chains,
Compaq emerged as their No.
1 vendor in the quarter.


ProLiant Servers provided the 
same leadership at the high end
of the computer spectrum that 
the Presario did at the con-
sumer end. With the ProLiant,
Compaq cemented its market 
position as No. 1 worldwide in 
PC-based servers. The 
ProLiants incorporate a host of
innovative features, including
SmartStart, Insight Manager
and fault tolerance, not to 
mention a performance range
competitive with far more 
expensive minicomputers and
mainframes.

The Presario and the ProLiant 
were far from the only exciting 
products we introduced in 
1993. In desktops, the
ProLinea line, aimed at small, 
medium and corporate cus-
tomers, was broadened and 
augmented substantially during
the year. And our flagship 
Deskpro, which has always 
represented the industry's 
highest performance in desk-
top computers, continued that
tradition in 1993 with the new
Deskpro XE.

Our Portable PC Division con-
tinued to enhance its line. The
LTE Lite, first shipped in
1992, led the industry in high-
performance, fully-featured 
notebooks. Our value-priced 


Conturas, also of 1992 vintage,
enjoyed major upgrades last 
year, and similarly enjoyed a 
concomitant rise in sales.

In fact, sales of both LTE and 
Contura color notebooks would 
have been far higher had more
active-matrix color panels been
available. Fortunately, two 
trends will work for us in 1994.

First, by the end of 1994, we 
hope to have qualified, and to
be supplied by, four or five
more suppliers.


With many of our retailer chains,
Compaq emerged as their No. 1 ven-
dor in the fourth quarter of 1993.

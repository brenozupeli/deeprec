Report of Management
Compaq Computer Corporation


Management of Compaq Computer Corporation is responsible for the preparation of the Company's financial 
statements. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and, as such, include amounts based on judgments and estimates made by management.

Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls that is designed to provide reasonable assurance
that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with management's 
policies for conducting its business. This system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business
standards and compliance with all laws to which the Company is subject. The internal controls process is
continuously monitored by direct management review and an internal audit program under which periodic
independent reviews are made.

Price Waterhouse, independent accountants, are retained to audit the Company's financial statements. Their 
accompanying report is based on an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
including a review of the internal control structure and test of accounting procedures and records.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of independent outside directors. The 
Committee meets periodically with the independent accountants, with the Company's internal auditors, and 
with the Company's management, to review accounting, auditing, internal control structure, and financial
reporting matters.

Report of Independent Accountants 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Compaq Computer Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and related consolidated statements of income,
cash flows and stockholders' equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Compaq
Computer Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's 
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We 
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

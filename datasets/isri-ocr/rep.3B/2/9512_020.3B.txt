Where is Kodak's future?

Kodak's future is in total customer
satisfaction.  And that means a continual and
relentless focus on the three primary drivers of
customer satisfaction:  Quality, reduced cycle
time, and product and service leadership.
Quality, because it is essential to improving
financial performance.  Cycle time, because in
today's competitive world, those who are first to


market get the highest margins and market share, and have the money to reinvest in the future.
Product and service leadership, because there is no substitute for it in the customer's eyes.

Kodak's future depends on the ability to take a set of valuable, unrivaled, innovative
resources, and then bring them to the marketplace


quickly to meet real customer needs.

And that means listening to the customer.
It relies on innovation and marketing savvy in the
research and development process.  It demands
world-class manufacturing and functional excel-
lence.  It depends on seamless execution in the
marketplace and, finally, it must always return to
the voice of the customer.


Kodak's future is in this never-ending cycle.  The desired result?  Continuous improvement,
leadership in products and services, satisfied employees and value to our publics.

This is Eastman Kodak Company-~extending the legacy of the Kodak name for quality,
value and a commitment to total customer satisfaction.

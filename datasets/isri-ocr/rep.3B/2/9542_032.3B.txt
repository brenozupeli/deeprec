The Company benefits from a tax holiday in Singapore which expires in 1997, subject to certain extensions.
During the first quarter of 1993 the Company determined that a portion of the undistributed earnings of its
Singaporean subsidiaries will be reinvested indefinitely. As a result of this determination, no provision for U.S.
income tax was made on $158 million of earnings of such subsidiaries during 1993. These earnings would
become subject to U.S. tax if they were actually or deemed to be remitted to the Company as dividends or if the
Company should sell its stock in these subsidiaries. The Company estimates an additional tax provision of $55
million would be required at such time.

Deferred tax liabilities (assets) at December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1993 (the date of adoption of FAS 109) are
comprised of the following:

The decrease in the deferred tax assets valuation allowance in 1993 of $11 million is primarily attributable to the
utilization (or expected future utilization) of loss carryforwards associated with certain of the Company's foreign
subsidiaries.

Deferred tax assets of $126 million and $78 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets
at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

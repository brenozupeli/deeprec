Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Operations and Financial Condition

INTRODUCTION

  This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operat-
ing results, financial condition and liquidity/cash flows of Anheuser-Busch
Companies, Inc. during the three-year period ended December 31, 1993.  This dis-
cussion should be read in conjunction with the Letter to Shareholders, financial
statements and financial statement footnotes included in this annual report.
   Two unusual occurrences had negative impacts on the company's 1993 earnings.  In
September 1993, the company announced a Profitability Enhancement Program which
includes significant organizational and operational changes to improve sales and prof-
itability.  The Program includes the following elements:
  ~ An enhanced retirement program for salaried employees
  ~ The write-down of underperforming assets and investments
  ~ The restructuring and reorganization of the company
  This Program is expected to generate cost savings of more than $100 million in 1994
and $400 million a year by 1997.
  The restructuring and reorganization element of the Program includes the following ini-
tiatives designed to increase efficiencies and reduce operating costs:
  ~ Brewery modernization programs based on the successful practices employed at the com-
    pany's newer breweries.  Such programs include increased employee involvement to
    improve quality and efficiency throughout the entire 13-brewery system.
  ~ Relocation of the company's food products operations to St. Louis.  Additionally, bakery
    facilities will be modernized and consolidated.
  The Program is also designed to improve sales of the company's premium beer prod-
ucts through aggressive advertising and the introduction of new products.  The company's
newest product, Ice Draft from Budweiser, was rolled out nationwide in January 1994.
  As a result of the Program, the company recognized a $565 million ($1.26 per share)
restructuring charge during the third quarter 1993.  Further information concerning the details
of the restructuring charge is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
  Additionally, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993, signed into law during the third
quarter 1993, increased the corporate federal statutory income tax rate by one percent-
age point retroactive to January 1, 1993.  This retroactive income tax rate increase resulted
in a $33 million, or $.12 per share, non-recurring after-tax, non-cash charge related to
revaluation of the deferred tax liability in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard
No. 109 (FAS 109)-~Accounting for Income Taxes.
  The non-recurring restructuring charge and the non-recurring deferred tax revaluation
charge distort comparability of 1993 and 1992 reported financial results.  To facilitate evaluation
and understanding of the company's 1993 financial results, key financial comparisons affected
by these charges are disclosed in this discussion both including and excluding the charges.
  Earnings for 1992 were impacted by the adoption of new accounting principles.
Effective January 1, 1992 as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the company adopted the financial accounting standards for postretirement
benefits (FAS 106) and income taxes (FAS 109).  The company elected to immediately rec-
ognize the cumulative effect of adoption of FAS 106/109 pertaining to years prior to
1992 through a one-time cumulative effect adjustment which decreased 1992 net
income and earnings per share by $76.7 million and $.26, respectively.  These amounts
are separately identified in the company's consolidated 1992 income statement.
  Implementation of FAS 106 in 1992 was based on benefit levels in effect at the time of adop-
tion.  Certain changes to these benefit levels were implemented in 1993, thereby reducing the
FAS 106 pretax expense amount in 1993 as compared to 1992 by $27.0 million to $48.3 million.


  The Profitability Enhancement
Program is expected to generate
cost savings of more than $100
million in 1994 and $400 million
a year by 1997.

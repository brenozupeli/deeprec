  To grow stronger in hard times is


the acid test of competitiveness.  McDonnell Douglas has met that challenge, as our


1993 results demonstrate.
  Along with other aerospace companies, MDC faced a deepening downturn in  military and commercial markets in 1993.
U.S. military aircraft expenditures declined 17% in real terms in 1993, and have fallen 36% since 1989.  Since 1991, there has also been a
drought in new orders for commercial aircraft.
  Despite the harsh environment, MDC had an extremely good year.  We had multiple successes in securing new business
essential to future growth.  Productivity and quality continued to rise -~ more than compensating for lower rates of production.
We achieved a strong increase in earnings and a dramatic reduction in aerospace debt.
  Shareholders benefited from MDC's performance.  From the beginning of the year to the end, the price per share of our stock
grew from $48 1/4 to $107 -~ a 122% increase.  By comparison, the S&P aerospace index rose by 27% in 1993. 
  The twin problems of excess capacity and lower levels of demand have led to a period of consolidation within the aerospace
industry.  Leading aerospace companies have pursued a variety of strategies.  Lockheed, Martin Marietta, and Loral have made
acquisitions to bolster their positions in key markets.  General Dynamics -~ our principal rival in fighter aircraft for many years -~ has
liquidated much of its defense business and returned cash to shareholders.  Grumman has announced withdrawal from the fighter
airframe business.
  MDC has tackled the problem of excess capacity head-on -~ by directly reducing capacity and instituting a number of
measures aimed at making the corporation better able to survive and flourish on a leaner diet.  In the past two years, for example, we
have decided to close four major fabrication plants in the U.S. By consolidating work in our remaining plants, we expect to make a
substantial improvement in average plant utilization.
  While reducing costs, we have tightened the focus of our objectives and strategies.  We have no intention of diversifying into
new and unfamiliar businesses.  In fact, over the past three years, we have shed peripheral businesses in information systems and
financial services.  Ours is a here-we-stand strategy.  It is based on a unique set of strengths as an aerospace company.
  The first of those strengths is our position in combat aircraft.  We are the world leader in that business.  MDC is producing a
total of four combat aircraft, plus the T-45 trainer.  No other company is producing more than two combat aircraft.
  We also have the dominant military transport aircraft of the future in the C-17 Globemaster III, which entered service with an
operational unit of the U.S. Air Force in 1993.  The only other military transport in production is the short-range, propeller-driven C-130

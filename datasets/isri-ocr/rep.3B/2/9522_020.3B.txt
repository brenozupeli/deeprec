BUSINESSES


     MCDONNELL DOUGLAS FINANCE CORPORATION (MDFC)

  While continuing to dispose of peripheral businesses, MDFC performed well in 1993 in its core markets of aircraft and commercial
equipment leasing.
  MDFC's aircraft financing operation provided about $450 million in financing for MDC commercial aircraft customers -~ more
than double the previous year's aircraft financing volume.  MDFC funding included purchases of two MD-83 aircraft for Transwede; two
MD-11s for Garuda; and six MD-83s for TWA.  Also, MDFC was instrumental in arranging another $1 billion in third-party financing for an
additional 24 aircraft.
    At year end, the MDFC aircraft portfolio totaled $1.3 billion, with MDC-built aircraft accounting for 82% of the total.
    MDFC's commercial equipment operation wrote $38 million in new leases in 1993 and ended the year with a portfolio totaling
$422 million.  Included in its business is the lease of corporate aircraft and other large equipment items.
    MDFC obtained better access to capital markets and lower borrowing costs as a result of


improved earnings and reduced debt of MDC, the parent corporation.  This improved access to capital
markets will enhance MDFC's competitiveness.

     MCDONNELL DOUGLAS REALTY COMPANY (MDRC)
  MDRC manages a 4.9 million square-foot real estate portfolio valued in excess of
$500 million.  In 1993, MDRC provided increased consulting services to other units in MDC which
were in the process of disposing of excess facilities.  MDRC negotiated rental reductions, audited
existing lease arrangements, and consolidated lease facilities to utilize space more efficiently.

     MCDONNELL DOUGLAS TECHNICAL SERVICES COMPANY (MDTSC)
  MDTSC's pool of experienced and skilled workers (including retirees) provided
$68 million of temporary professional assistance to MDC and other employers in 1993.  For the
second consecutive year, MDTSC's business increased by more than 50% as it placed professionals
in over 3,000 contract assignments within MDC and at commercial clients.  In 1993, MDTSC
provided increased services in commercial markets for engineering, computer software
development, and aircraft maintenance.

     MCDONNELL DOUGLAS TRAVEL COMPANY (MDTC)
  MDTC increased business travel sales to $169 million in 1993, up 11% from 1992.
External sales increased to over two thirds of total sales, reflecting MDTC's increasing penetration
into the business travel market.  MDTC's primary client remains the MDC business traveler.

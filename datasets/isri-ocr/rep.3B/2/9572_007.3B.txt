Cash Flow -~ Key to Growth


In 1993, Unocal began to implement a ten-year plan for growth with
a strategy firmly focused on our basic businesses and core competi-
tive strengths. Our goals are aggressive, but our strategy is flexible
enough to allow us to respond quickly to changing energy markets
and emerging investment opportunities.
  Cash flow from operations is the key to growth. We'll strengthen
cash flow over the next decade primarily by increasing energy re-
source production. We'll also emphasize cost control and continu-
ous improvement in all of our activities.
  For the next three years, most production increases will come
from our accelerated North American development program, which 
is centered on the Gulf of Mexico. This program, launched in 1993, 
began to show results by year end. Lower-than-expected oil prices 
at the beginning of 1994 caused us to shift our development em-
phasis toward natural gas, where prices remain strong. This shift 
and reduction in capital spending, if extended over most of the year, 
may delay achievement of our production goals later in the decade.
  Over the longer term, our growth strategy is based on expanding 
our extensive oil, gas and geothermal operations in Southeast Asia.
We expect to help develop the energy resource potential in the 
Greater Middle East, including the Caspian Sea, and other areas of 
the world where our skills and technologies provide a competitive
edge. We will continue to forge strategic alliances and partnerships
to become more competitive in the global energy economy.

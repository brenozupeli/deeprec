USX


Management's Report


The accompanying consolidated financial statements of USX Corporation and Subsidiary Companies
(USX) are the responsibility of and have been prepared by USX in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.  They necessarily include some amounts that are based on best judgments and
estimates.  The consolidated financial information displayed in other sections of this report is con-
sistent with that in these consolidated financial statements.
  USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its financial records by careful selection of its
managers, by organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate division of responsibility and
by communications programs aimed at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
throughout the organization.
  USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal accounting controls designed to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that financial records are reliable.  Appropriate
management monitors the system for compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure its
effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto.  In addition, as part of their audit of the
consolidated financial statements, USX's independent accountants, who are elected by the stockholders,
review and test the internal accounting controls selectively to establish a basis of reliance thereon in
determining the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be applied.
  The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the area of financial reporting and internal
accounting control through its Audit Committee.  This Committee, composed solely of nonmanagement
directors, regularly meets (jointly and separately) with the independent accountants, management and
internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each of its responsibilities relative to internal
accounting controls and the consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Accountants


To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:


In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing on pages 34 through 56
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of USX Corporation and Subsidiary Companies
at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of USX's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion expressed above.
  As discussed in Note 1, page 40, in 1993 USX adopted new accounting standards for
postemployment benefits and for retrospectively rated insurance contracts.  As discussed in Note 8,
page 45, and Note 9, page 46, in 1992 USX adopted new accounting standards for postretirement
benefits other than pensions and for income taxes, respectively.

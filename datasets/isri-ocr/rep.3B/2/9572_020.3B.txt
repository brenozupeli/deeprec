Corporate Responsibility


Unocal supports a variety of activities in the com-
munities where its employees live and work, recog-
nizing a responsibility to be a good citizen and a
good neighbor.

Disaster Relief

Southern California was struck by devastating fires in
the fall of 1993 and a major earthquake in January 
1994. Unocal donated equipment, labor and supplies
to help support emergency response and disaster relief
activities. Contributions included $150,000 to the 
American Red Cross and free fuel for emergency ve-
hicles.

National Sponsorship of Youth Soccer

In September, Unocal kicked off a three-year spon-
sorship of the American Youth Soccer Organization
(AYSO) program, including the TEAM UP program
for inner city and other economically disadvantaged 
communities. As part of the sponsorship, Unocal is
donating about 60,000 soccer balls over the three 
years. The balls are manufactured to look like the 
familiar orange-and-blue sphere that identifies
Unocal 76 service stations. In 1994, the company
will be a sponsor of the AYSO World Games to be
played at venues in Hawaii, California, and Michigan.
AYSO involves more than 425,000 youths in 42 states.

Creative Methods to Help Clean the Air

In the summer of 1993, Unocal completed the first 
old-car scrapping project conducted under the South
Coast Air Quality Management District's Rule 1610,
which allows a business to earn emissions credits by
scrapping old cars. Unocal introduced the concept of
scrapping older, heavily polluting cars as a cost-effec-
tive method of reducing emissions with its original 
SCRAP program in 1990. Rule 1610 is one of several 
programs across the country that have been inspired 
by SCRAP. Unocal's 1993 SCRAP program involved 
the purchase of 335 cars, model years 1971 and


older (before catalytic converters were introduced).
In total, these cars produced an estimated 37,000
pounds of hydrocarbon emissions and 10,000
pounds of NOx emissions every year. Unocal was
credited with about 80 percent of the total emis-
sions, which are used to offset hydrocarbon emis-
sions from product-loading operations at the Los
Angeles refinery's marine terminal. The credits are
good for three years.
  Rule 1610 is designed so that auto scrapping pro-
grams remove 20 percent more emissions than the 
emissions-control measures they offset -~ providing a
clean air bonus to the affected communities.


Coast Guard Commends Unocal's Actions

In May 1993, the U.S. Coast Guard invited Unocal 
to conduct emergency response management train-
ing for its Gulf Strike Team in Mobile, Alabama.
This stemmed from Unocal's quick and effective ac-
tion in controlling and cleaning up a spill from its
Beaumont (Texas) terminal in April. The company 
also received Coast Guard praise in Alaska for its
prompt response to a small oil spill from a platform
in the Cook Inlet.

Environmental Remediation

Unocal's Corporate Environmental Remediation &
Technology Division, formed in 1991, has two man-
dates: to remediate Unocal sites so they can be put
to new uses or sold, and to develop and market new
remediation technologies.
  In February 1994, CERT Environmental Corp.
and UTILX Corporation formed a new environmental
services company. FlowMole Environmental Services
Corporation (FES) will use a combination of UTILX 
horizontal drilling technology and Unocal's advanced 
in situ treatment techniques to clean up petroleum-
contaminated sites. Each company holds a 50 per-
cent interest in FES, which is headquartered in
Kent, Washington.


Unocal Sponsors 4-H 
After-School

The 4-H After-School 
program in Los Ange-
les County gives "at-
risk" kids an alterna-
tive to the streets,
offering exciting learn-
ing opportunities and
incentives to develop
good study habits. The
goal is to set up pro-
grams at 51 housing 
developments and el-
ementary schools by
early 1996. So far, 5
are in place. Unocal 
contributed nearly 
$60,000 to 4-H After
School in 1993 and 
helped obtain more
than $400,000 in addi-
tional funding.

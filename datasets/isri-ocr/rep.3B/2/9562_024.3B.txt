Pfizer's Animal Health Group is moving toward 
what promises to be the most significant period
of growth in its history. The group is in the early
stages of introducing three major new products-~
Dectomax, Advocin and Aviax-~around the world.
These innovative products add significant thera-
peutic value to the practice of animal husbandry.
They, along with the technical assistance needed
to use them for best results, will be important addi-
tions to the line of products which the Animal
Health Group markets to the large producers of
food animals.
  Operationally, 1993 was an exciting year. We 
launched Dectomax in its first markets. Advocin
sales continued to expand, and sales of in-line
products maintained excellent levels. We also
began a number of restructuring projects which
we expect will contribute significantly to our
future profitability. A major element of our restruc-
turing was the formation of the North American 
Animal Health Division, a fully integrated opera-
tion serving the U.S. and Canada. By moving the
headquarters of this new division to Lee's Summit,
Missouri-~within 1,000 miles of all our major cus-
tomers-~we have made it possible for our senior 
management to work more closely with the largest 
food producers, while at the same time reducing
costs and improving efficiency.
  Beginning in 1994, the Animal Health Group 
expects to realize significant growth in both sales
and profit. New products should account for at
least 40 percent of worldwide sales by 1998. In 
addition, new drug candidates already in our dis-
covery research facilities hold the promise of a 
substantial pipeline of new products well into the
next century.


  Dectomax is the most important of our new
products. It has a broader spectrum of activity 
against parasites than any other animal health


product, and it is effective longer as well.
We introduced Dectomax in Brazil, 
Argentina and South Africa in the second
half of 1993 with notable success.
Customers have shown widespread enthu-
siasm about how well their animals are


doing on the product. The early success of 
Dectomax in Brazil, the world's second-largest cat-
tle market, is a significant indicator of its potential.
  Sales of Advocin, our fluoroquinolone antibac-
terial for livestock, increased significantly in 1993
largely on the strength of its successful introduc-
tion in Japan. The product is now available 
throughout most of Latin America, Africa and 
Asia. By late 1995, we expect to begin rolling it out
in the large markets of Europe and the U.S., where
respiratory disease is a major problem.
  Aviax, a Pfizer-discovered product for the treat-
ment of coccidiosis in chickens, should be intro-
duced shortly. It has already been approved in 
most of Latin America. Aviax will complement
Coxistac, a licensed anticoccidial  which we mar-
ket outside the U.S. and Europe. Since poultry 
producers generally rotate their flocks between
three or four anticoccidials, it will enhance our
sales opportunities where we market Coxistac and
will open up a whole new business for Pfizer in 
those countries where we do not.
  In addition to introducing innovative new prod-
ucts developed by our researchers, the Animal
Health Group is working hard to improve the prof-
itability of its existing world markets and products.
Our flagship in-line product, TM/LA, continued to
show excellent growth-~particularly in the West-
ern Hemisphere, where sales increased by 29 per-
cent. Sales of our anthelmintic family of products
rose by 13 percent, and Coxistac sales increased by
9 percent. The 9 percent decline in operating profit
reflects the initial manufacturing start-up expenses
for several new products as well as heavy expendi-
tures to support new product introductions.


Dectomax, our new
antiparasitic agent for
livestock, met with notable
success in Brazil in 1993.

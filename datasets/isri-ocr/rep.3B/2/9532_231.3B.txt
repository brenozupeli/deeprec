USX


Management's Discussion and Analysis   CONTINUED


Due 2002, 9-3/4% to March 1, 1994 and 7% thereafter.  During 1992, USX issued an aggregate
principal amount of $748 million of fixed rate debt through its medium-term note program and
three separate series of unsecured, noncallable debt securities in the public market.  Maturities
ranged from 5 to 30 years and interest rates ranged from 6.65% to 9.375% per annum.  During
1991, debt borrowings included the issuance of three separate series of unsecured, noncallable
debt securities in the public market in the aggregate principal amount of $550 million and a $300
million loan to Marathon Oil U. K., Ltd. from the European Investment Bank.

  Preferred stock issued totaled $336 million in 1993.  This amount reflected the sale of
6,900,000 shares of 6.50% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ($50.00 liquidation preference
per share) ("6.50% Convertible Preferred") to the public for net proceeds of $336 million.  The
6.50% Convertible Preferred is convertible at any time into shares of USX-~U. S. Steel Group
Common Stock ("Steel Stock") at a conversion price of $46.125 per share of Steel Stock.

  Common stock issued, net of repurchases, totaled $371 million in 1993, compared with
$942 million in 1992 and $70 million in 1991.  The 1993 amount mainly reflected the sale of
10,000,000 shares of Steel Stock to the public for net proceeds of $350 million.  The increase in
1992 primarily reflected sales to the public of all three classes of common stock.  In 1992, USX
sold 25,000,000 shares of USX-~Marathon Group Common Stock ("Marathon Stock") for net
proceeds of $541 million, 8,050,000 shares of Steel Stock for net proceeds of $198 million and
9,000,000 shares of USX-~Delhi Group Common Stock for net proceeds of $136 million.

  Dividend payments decreased in 1993 primarily due to a decrease in the dividend rate on
Marathon Stock in the fourth quarter of 1992, partially offset by increased dividends due
primarily to the sale in 1993 of additional shares of Steel Stock and of the 6.50% Convertible
Preferred.  The increase in 1992 from 1991 primarily resulted from higher dividends due to the
sale of additional shares of all three classes of common stock in 1992, partially offset by the fourth
quarter decrease in the dividend rate on Marathon Stock.

  In September 1993, Standard & Poor's Corp.  ("S&P") lowered its ratings on USX's and
Marathon's senior debt to below investment grade (from BBB- to BB+) and on USX's
subordinated debt, preferred stock and commercial paper.  S&P cited extremely aggressive
financial leverage, burdensome retiree medical liabilities and litigation contingencies.  In October
1993, Moody's Investors Services, Inc. ("Moody's") confirmed its Baa3 investment grade ratings on
USX's and Marathon's senior debt.  Moody's also confirmed its ratings on USX's subordinated debt
and commercial paper, but lowered its ratings on USX's preferred stock from ba1 to ba2.  Moody's
noted that the rating confirmation on USX debt securities reflected confidence in the expected
performance of USX during the intermediate term, while the downward revision of the preferred
stock ratings incorporated a narrow fixed charge coverage going forward.  The downgrades by S&P
and the downgrade of ratings on preferred stock by Moody's could increase USX's cost of capital.

  In December 1993, USX filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission which became effective on January 6, 1994 and allows USX to offer and
issue up to $850 million of debt and equity securities.  The equity securities include preferred
stock as well as each class of USX's common stock.  In February 1994, USX sold 5,000,000 shares
of Steel Stock to the public for net proceeds of $201 million and issued $300 million in aggregate
principal amount of 7.2% Notes Due 2004 under the shelf registration.

  In February 1994, USX issued $150 million in aggregate principal amount of LIBOR-based
Floating Rate Notes Due 1996 through its medium-term note program under a shelf registration
statement which became effective on April 26, 1993.

  As a result of the settlement of LTV Steel Corp.'s ("LTV") portion of the B&LE litigation, USX
is obligated to pay an additional $175 million to LTV in the first quarter of 1994.  In addition,

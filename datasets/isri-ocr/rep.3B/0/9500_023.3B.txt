poor economy. In the North American market, automotive
and truck brakes, safety restraints, aftermarket products and
turbochargers had substantial earnings growth. Productivity
improvements and higher sales volumes substantially reduced
prior year losses in Brazil. The 1993 results include an after-
tax charge of $3 million reflecting the current year's impact of
adopting FASB No. 112.
  The Company introduced new ABS products in Europe and 
the U.S. in 1993 which strengthened its position in braking
systems for new vehicle production. Although its market share
remains less than 10 percent, the Company is developing
more advanced technology that should strengthen its competi-
tive position by 1996.
  Increased competitive activity across all product lines and
increasing product and cost demands from customers will
continue to put pressure on the Company's automotive busi-
ness. However, the Company believes it will more than offset
these market conditions through product innovation, aggres-
sive productivity actions to reduce costs and by accelerating
the process of supplying integrated automotive systems to the
global marketplace. To improve operating efficiencies, the
Company initiated plans in 1991 and 1992 to significantly 
reduce the number of its worldwide locations. By the end of
1993, 20 operating plants had been closed. Sales offices, distri-
bution centers and research and development facilities are
also being consolidated.

  Engineered Materials had a 7 percent sales increase. Sales
of fluorine products, including environmentally-safer substi-
tutes for CFCs, grew substantially and sales of laminate sys-
tems, oximes, performance additives and tar products were
materially higher. Sales of carpet and industrial fibers also
improved, but sales of intermediate chemicals and environ-
mental catalysts were lower because of weak market
conditions.
  Engineered Materials' adjusted net income was significantly
higher in 1993 because of strong productivity gains and
improved revenues for fluorine products, industrial fibers, per-
formance additives and tar products. Results also improved for
UOP. Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating
costs for laminate systems, reduced demand for intermediate
chemicals and lower earnings for Paxon. 1993 results include
an after-tax charge of $2 million reflecting the current year's
impact of adopting FASB No. 112.
  Regarding environmental matters, the Company is
subject to various federal, state and local requirements relating
to the protection of the environment. The Company believes
that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures
are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environ-
mental damage and that its handling, manufacture, use and
disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with
environmental laws and regulations. However, mainly because
of past operations and operations of predecessor companies,
the Company is a party to lawsuits and claims and has
incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs asso-
ciated with environmental matters. Additional lawsuits, claims
and costs involving environmental matters are likely to con-
tinue to arise in the future. The Company continually con-
ducts studies, individually at Company-owned sites, and jointly


as a member of industry groups at non-owned sites, to deter-
mine the feasibility of various remedial techniques to address
environmental matters. The Company records appropriate lia-
bilities for such matters when environmental assessments are
made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. The timing of these accruals is generally
on the completion of feasibility studies or the settlement of
claims, but in no event later than the Company's commitment
to a plan of action.
  Remedial response and voluntary cleanup expenditures
were $65 and $69 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively, and
are currently estimated to increase to approximately $96 mil-
lion in 1994. While annual expenditures have generally
increased from year-to-year, and may continue to increase over
time, the Company expects it will be able to fund such
expenditures from cash flow from operations. The timing of
expenditures depends on a number of factors, including regu-
latory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be
utilized and agreements with other parties.
  During 1993 the Company charged $41 million against
income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs. At
December 31, 1993 the recorded liability for environmental 
matters was $480 million. In addition, the Company incurred
ongoing operating costs, and made capital expenditures of
$39 million, relating to compliance with environmental
regulations.
  Although the Company does not currently possess suffi-
cient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of liabili-
ties to be recorded upon future completion of studies or
settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the
ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be
determined, they may be significant to the Company's consoli-
dated results of operations. Management does not expect that
environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial position of the Company.
  See Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements for a discus-
sion of the Company's commitments and contingencies,
including those related to environmental matters.
  Inflation has not been a significant factor for the Company
in recent years. Cost increases for labor and material have
generally been low, and any impact has been offset by pro-
ductivity enhancement programs.

    inancial Condition. Cash flow from operating
    activities was materially higher as a result of
    strong earnings growth and a strengthening bal-
    ance sheet which reflects greatly improved operat-
    ing working capital and a significant customer
    advance.

  Total assets at December 31, 1993 were $10,829
million, an increase of $73 million from December 31, 1992.
Cash and cash equivalents at year-end 1993 were $892 mil-
lion, a decrease of $39 million, however, cash investments
classified as long-term increased $40 million, to $90 million, at
December 31, 1993. Cash flows from operating activities, pro-
vided by significantly improved earnings for 1993 and a reduc-
tion in working capital, increased by $111 million. The cur-
rent ratio at year-end 1993 was 1.3x, down slightly from 1.4x
at December 31, 1992. Mainly through a reduction in
accounts receivable and inventories, the Company's working
capital turnover was improved to 4.8x at December 31, 1993
from 4.5x a year earlier.

Cash Flow From Operations
International Paper continued to generate substantial cash
flow in 1993 despite lower operating earnings. However,
cash provided by operations of $929 million in 1993 was
below the $1.1 billion in 1992 and $1.2 billion in 1991.
During 1993, working capital increased $290 million, most
of which was from lower accounts payable and accrued lia-
bilities. An increase in depreciation and amortization
charges in 1993 to $898 million from $850 million in 1992
and $725 million in 1991 mitigated the effect of lower net 
earnings on cash flow.

Investment Activities
Capital spending of $954 million in 1993 was well below the
$1.4 billion and $1.2 billion spent in 1992 and 1991. This
reduced spending reflects completion of several major proj-
ects in late 1992 including Zanders' new paper machine for
the production of high-quality base papers and expansion of
Aussedat Rey's Saillat pulp mill.
 As in recent years, 1993 capital spending largely focused
on further reduction of production costs, plant upgrades
and incremental capacity expansions, quality and produc-
tivity improvements, and environmental and safety pro-

grams. During 1993, the project at Lock Haven, Pa.,to 
produce 100% recycled-paper grades from postconsumer
newspapers and magazines was completed and started
production late in the year. Also, one paper machine at
Kwidzyn, in Poland, was upgraded to improve productivity.
 Capital spending for 1994 is expected to exceed
$1.1 billion. Major projects will focus on printing papers
and packaging facilities. In the United States, the design
for a new, low-cost uncoated paper machine at the Riverdale
mill near Selma, Ala., was completed and the majority of 
spending for this project will occur during 1994. In Europe,
the $175 million capital investment program for Kwidzyn
will continue.
 Spending for acquisitions decreased substantially in
1993. In 1993, $35 million was spent and $22 million of
debt  was assumed to acquire certain assets of Los Angeles-
based Ingram Paper Company, a distributor of industrial
and fine writing papers, and the assets of Monsanto Com-
pany's Fome-Cor division, a manufacturer of polystyrene
foam boards. The Company also acquired the assets of JB
Papers, Inc., a paper distribution company located in Union,
N.J., by issuing 117,000 shares of Company common stock.
 In 1992, $153 million was spent and $30 million ac-
crued, principally for the acquisitions of Kwidzyn in Poland
and Western Pacific in Oregon. The Company also spent
$209 million to acquire an equity interest in Scitex, a world
leader in color electronic prepress systems.
 In 1991, $457 million was spent and $50 million of debt
assumed to acquire the Rhone Valley Packaging business,
Evergreen Packaging Equipment, Dillard Paper Company
and Scaldia Papier BV. A merger with Leslie Paper Company
and the formation of a joint venture to control 32% of Carter
Holt Harvey Limited were also completed in 1991.

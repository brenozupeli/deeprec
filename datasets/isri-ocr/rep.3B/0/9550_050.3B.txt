10. RETIREMENT PLANS:       The company maintains retirement plans for the majority of its employees. Benefits are based on years of service and compensation
or stated amounts for each year of service. Plan assets are primarily invested in equities and fixed income securities. The company's
funding policy for the domestic plans is to contribute annually not less than the ERISA minimum funding standards nor more than the
maximum amount which can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. Generally, foreign plans are funded in amounts sufficient
to comply with local regulations and ensure adequate funds to pay benefits to retirees as they become due.
  Net pension costs consisted of the following:


(Dollars in thousands)  1994 1993 1992
Benefits earned during the year   $ 15,215   $ 20,384  $ 22,801
Interest cost on projected benefit obligation   66,706  65,612  66,668
Actual return on plan assets  (98,673)  (98,358)  (105,940)
Net amortization and deferral  25,028  21,292  23,235
Net pension costs  $ 8,276  $ 8,930  $ 6,764


The following table sets forth the combined funded status of the company's principal plans at April 27, 1994 and April 28, 1993.


(Dollars in thousands)  1994 1993
Actuarial present value of:
  Accumulated benefit obligation, primarily vested  $775,986  $748,089
  Additional obligation for projected compensation increases  43,074 69,992
Projected benefit obligation  819,060 818,081
Plan assets, at fair value  933,257 908,745
Plan assets in excess of projected benefit obligation   114,197 90,664
Unamortized prior service cost  60,238 63,427
Unamortized actuarial losses, net  22,910 56,819
Unamortized net assets at date of adoption  (36,885) (44,688)
Prepaid pension costs  $160,460 $166,222


The weighted average rates used for the years ended April 27, 1994, April 28, 1993 and April 29, 1992 in determining the net
pension costs and projected benefit obligations were as follows:


1994 1993 1992
Expected rate of return on plan assets  10.0% 10.1% 10.1%
Discount rate  8.3% 8.6% 8.8%
Compensation increase rate  4.8% 6.2% 6.7%


Assumptions for foreign plans are developed on a basis consistent with those for U.S. plans, adjusted for prevailing economic conditions.
  In April 1992, the Board of Directors amended the domestic salaried defined benefit pension plan to provide that no benefits 
would accrue under this plan on or after January 1, 1993. At the same time, the Board expanded, effective January 1, 1993, the
defined contribution plan covering substantially all domestic salaried employees, described below. The Board's actions on the defined 
benefit pension plan resulted in an after-tax curtailment gain of $23.6 million, which was recorded in 1992. No plan assets were
withdrawn from the pension plan as a result of this curtailment.
  The company maintains defined contribution plans for the majority of its domestic non-union and salaried employees.
Benefits are provided through company contribution accounts which consist solely of company contributions that are a percentage of
the participant's pay based on age, with the contribution rate increasing with age. In addition, certain non-union employees receive
supplemental contributions, which are paid at the discretion of the company, and matching contributions based on a percentage of the
participant's contributions to the 401(k) portion of the plan. (The company's matching contributions for salaried employees are
provided under the ESOP.) The expense recognized as a result of company contributions to the defined contribution plans, excluding
the ESOP, totaled $16.5 million in 1994. In 1993, $4.5 million was expensed for the company defined contribution plans.

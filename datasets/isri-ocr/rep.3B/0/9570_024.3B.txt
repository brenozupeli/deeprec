Department of National Defence. Any future declines in defense industry spending could affect the 
Company's ability to obtain new defense contracts, and no assurance can be given that current, in-
process, multiple-year contracts will not be downsized or discontinued.
  Total gross profit margin increased to 37% in 1993 from 36% in 1992. Sales gross profit margin in 1993
was 41% compared to 38% in 1992; services gross profit margin for 1993 was 23% compared to 21% in 1992;
and equipment maintenance gross profit margin for 1993 was 43% compared to 42% in 1992. Excluding 
restructuring charges, in 1991 the total gross profit margin was 32%, sales gross profit margin was 33%,
services gross profit margin was 17%, and equipment maintenance gross profit margin was 40%. Prior
years' services gross profit margin reflects a reclassification of certain selling, general and administrative
expenses to cost of services to conform with the 1993 presentation of such costs. This reclassification was
made to better match service costs with service revenue and produced no change to operating profit.


  Selling, general and administrative expenses for 1993 was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 7% from $1.8 billion in 1992. The decline 
was principally due to the effects of continued tight cost management and foreign currency translation. Selling, general and
administrative expenses for 1992 were $1.8 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 1991. Exclusive of restructuring charges in 1991,
selling, general and administrative expenses declined 10%. The decline was principally due to the Company's repositioning
actions. Total employment at December 31, 1993 was approximately 49,000 compared to approximately 54,300 at December 31, 
1992 and 60,300 at December 31, 1991.

  Research and development expenses in 1993 were $515.2 million compared to $535.9 million in 1992, a decline of 4%.
Research and development expenses in 1992 were $535.9 million compared to $638.9 million in 1991. Exclusive of special charges
in 1991, research and development expenses declined 9% in 1992 from 1991. The decline in all periods resulted from repositioning
actions which reduced managerial and administrative costs and focused research and development efforts on core products.


  As a result of the above, operating income was $734.1 million in 1993 (9.5% of revenue) com-
pared to $720.7 million in 1992 (8.6% of revenue) and an operating loss of $578.9 million in 1991
($245.3 million operating income exclusive of special charges, 2.8% of revenue).
  Interest expense was $241.7 million in 1993, down from $340.6 million in 1992, reflecting prin-
cipally lower average debt levels. Interest expense in 1992 was down from $407.6 million in 1991, 
reflecting both lower average debt levels and lower average interest rates.
  Other income in 1993 was $11.0 million compared to $55.5 million in 1992 and an expense of 
$301.8 million in 1991. Excluding special charges of $375.4 million, 1991 other income was $73.6 
million. Included in 1993 is a charge of $20.0 million related to the "Ill Wind" settlement. This set-
tlement requires the Company to make contingency payments based on proceeds from asset sales
and on net income. The maximum contingent amount payable in 1994 under this settlement agree-
ment is $30.0 million.

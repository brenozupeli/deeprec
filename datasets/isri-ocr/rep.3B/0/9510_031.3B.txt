A	Special Charge and Accounting Change

The second quarter of 1993 included a special pretax charge of
$180 by Marion Merrell Dow Inc.  This special charge reflected
Marion Merrell Dow's plans to reduce its work force in line with
current business conditions and redesign its U.S. business organiza-
tion.  The Company holds an interest in Marion Merrell Dow Inc.
of approximately 72 percent.
	During the fourth quarter of 1992, opportunities were identi-
fied to streamline the Company and a special pretax charge of $433
was taken.  This charge reflected asset write-offs and write-downs,
plant shutdowns, divestitures and the consolidation of a variety of
business activities globally.  Included were costs related to work
force reductions associated with these activities.
	The fourth quarter of 1991 included a special pretax charge of
$370 for shutdown and divestiture of a variety of facilities and busi-
ness activities primarily in basic chemicals and plastics.  The deci-
sion to take this special charge was consistent with Dow's strategy
to divert into specialties.  Actions contemplated by the 1992 and
1991 special charges are substantially complete, with no significant
adjustments required to the estimates.
	Effective December 31, 1993, the Company adopted FASB
Statement No. 115 ("Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities").  This statement requires certain invest-
ments in debt and equity securities to be classified as either
Trading, Available-for-Sale, or Held-to-Maturity.  Investments clas-
sified as Trading are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and
losses included in income.  Investments classified as Available-for-
Sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
recorded in a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Investments classified as Held-to-Maturity are recorded at amor-


tized cost.  The impact on net income for the year was not material.
The effect of the change was an increase to stockholders' equity of
$107.  Prior year amounts were not restated.
	The Company will adopt FASB Statement No. 112
("Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits") in 1994,
and anticipates that the financial impact will not be material.
	Effective January 1, 1992, Dow adopted FASB Statement
No. 106 ("Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions"), FASB Statement No. 107 ("Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments") and FASB Statement
No. 109 ("Accounting for Income Taxes").  Financial statements
prior to 1992 were not restated.
	FASB Statement No. 106 requires employers to recognize the
cost of certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to
retirees and their dependents as a liability during the employees'
active years of service.  In making the transition to adopt this
required accounting standard, a charge of $994 or $3.66 per share
was made against 1992 net income.  This change also had the effect
of increasing 1992 pretax operating expenses from $58 (under the
previous accounting method) to $165.
	FASB Statement No. 109 changes the method of accounting
for income taxes.  The favorable cumulative effect of implementation
was $229 or 84 cents per share.  The credit for deferred income taxes
for 1992 would have been $191 if prepared in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 11 instead of the
$295 recorded under FASB Statement No. 109.
	The $229 favorable impact, together with the $994 charge
mentioned above, are shown as a net cumulative charge of $765
against 1992 net income.

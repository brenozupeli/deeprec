Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Unisys Corporation

1. Summary of significant accounting policies

Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all
wholly owned subsidiaries. Investments in companies representing
ownership interests of 20% to 50% are accounted for by the equity
method.

Cash equivalents
All short-term investments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less are classified as cash equivalents.

Marketable securities 
Marketable securities, consisting principally of U.S. Government 
securities, are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approxi-
mates market.

Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is deter-
mined principally on the first-in, first-out method.

Properties, rental equipment and depreciation
Properties and rental equipment are carried at cost and are depreci-
ated over the estimated lives of such assets using the straight-line
method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
the asset lives or the terms of the respective leases. The principal
rates used are summarized below by classification of properties:


Rate per Year (%)
Buildings 2-5
Machinery and equipment	5-25
Tools and test equipment 10-33~~~
Rental equipment 25


Revenue recognition
Sales revenue is generally recorded upon shipment of product in the 
case of sales contracts, upon shipment of the program in the case of
software, and upon installation in the case of sales-type leases.
Revenue from service and rental agreements is recorded as earned
over the lives of the respective contracts.


Revenue under cost-type contracts is recognized when costs are
incurred, and under fixed-price contracts when products or services
are accepted and billings can be made. General and administrative 
expenses are charged to income as incurred. Cost of revenue under
long-term contracts is charged based on current estimated total 
costs. When estimates indicate a loss under a contract, cost of rev-
enue is charged with a provision for such loss.

Income taxes
Income taxes are provided on taxable income at the statutory rates
applicable to such income. Deferred taxes have not been provided 
on the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
since such amounts are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.

Earnings per common share
In 1993 and 1992, the computation of primary earnings per share was
based on the weighted average number of outstanding common
shares and additional shares assuming the exercise of stock options.
The computation of fully diluted earnings per share for both years
further assumes the conversion of the 8~~~% convertible subordinated 
notes due August 1, 2000. The computation of fully diluted earnings
per share for 1993 further assumes conversion of Series A Cumu-
lative Convertible Preferred Stock. In 1991, both primary and fully
diluted earnings per common share were based on the weighted 
average number of outstanding common shares. The inclusion of
additional shares assuming the conversion of Series A Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock would have been antidilutive in 1992
and 1991. The shares used in the computations for the three years 
ended December 31, 1993 were as follows (in thousands):


1993 1992 1991
Primary 165,070	163,725	161,552
Fully diluted 246,550 181,813 161,552


Cost in excess of net assets acquired
Cost in excess of net assets acquired represents the excess of cost
over fair value of the net assets of Sperry Corporation and 
Convergent, Inc., which is being amortized on the straight-line
method over 40 years and 12 years, respectively. Accumulated amor-
tization at December 31, 1993 and 1992 was $524.7 and $483.4 mil-
lion, respectively.

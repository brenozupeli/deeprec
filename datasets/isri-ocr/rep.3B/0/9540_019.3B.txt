  Productivity and cost control improvements contributed to profitability
and were largely responsible for the Company's ability to buck negative trends
in the petrochemicals market. A new benzene splitter came on-line at the 
Lake Charles facility, increasing production 28 percent over 1992 levels. 
Polymer propylene production of 312 million pounds set a new record and
represented an 11 percent increase over 1992. At Corpus Christi, aromatics
production increased 4 percent, reducing CITGO's dependence on 
outside feedstock suppliers.
  Petrochemicals customers recognized CITGO's commitment to customer
satisfaction. Monsanto presented CITGO Petrochemicals its Preferred 
Cyclohexane Supplier Award for the fifth consecutive year, and cumene
customer General Electric Plastics continued to honor CITGO as a Partner in
Quality. In early 1994, CITGO's cyclohexane and cumene processes at the
Corpus Christi refinery were recommended for ISO 9002 certification,
reflecting thousands of hours of work in 1993 by a cross-functional team of
engineers, laboratory personnel and operations representatives.


Petrochemicals

  CITGO's petrochemicals 
production and sales 
reached record highs in 
1993, despite a declining 
international market. As 
employees sought new 
ways of eliminating waste
and improving quality,
sales volumes increased by
11 percent and profits by 
1.9 percent. CITGO 
produced and sold a 
record-setting amount of
cyclohexane in 1993 -
7 percent more than 
in 1992.

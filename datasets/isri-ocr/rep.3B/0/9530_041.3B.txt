Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.  Accounting Policies

  Shell Oil Company (the Company) is wholly owned by
Shell Petroleum Inc., a Delaware corporation, whose shares
are directly or indirectly owned 60 percent by Royal Dutch
Petroleum Company, The Hague, The Netherlands, and 40
percent by The "Shell" Transport and Trading Company,
public limited company, London, England.
  This summary of the major accounting policies of Shell
Oil Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (Shell Oil) is
presented to assist the reader in evaluating Shell Oil's finan-
cial statements and other data contained in this report.

Cash Equivalents -~ Cash equivalents consist of highly liq-
uid investments that are readily convertible into cash and
have a maturity of three months or less.

Inventories -~ Inventories of oils and chemicals are valued at
cost predominantly on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis which
is lower than market.  Materials and supplies are carried at
average cost or less.

Exploration and Development -~ Exploration and develop-
ment expenditures are accounted for according to the "suc-
cessful efforts" method of accounting.
  Property Acquisition Costs -~ Direct costs of acquiring
developed or undeveloped leasehold acreage including lease
bonus, brokerage and other fees are capitalized.  The cost of
undeveloped properties which become productive is trans-
ferred to a producing property account.
  Exploratory Costs -~ Exploratory expenses, including
geological and geophysical expenses and annual delay rentals
on oil and gas leases, are charged to income as incurred.
Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but should
the efforts be determined to be unsuccessful, they are then
charged against income.
  Development Costs -~ Costs incurred to drill and equip
development wells, including dry holes, platform costs, well equip-
ment costs and attendant production facilities costs are capitalized.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization -~ Deprecia-
tion, depletion and amortization of the capitalized cost of
producing properties, both tangible and intangible, are pro-
vided for on a unit of production basis.  Developed reserves
are used in computing unit rates for drilling and development
costs, and total proved reserves are used for depletion of lease-
hold costs.  The predominant basis for unit determination is
by field.  Amortization of unproven leasehold costs from date
of acquisition is based primarily upon experience in establish-
ing rates to fully amortize over the holding period those leas-
es that may be unproductive.  Estimated dismantlement,


restoration and abandonment costs and estimated residual
salvage values are taken into account in determining amorti-
zation and depreciation provisions.
  Other plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-
line basis over their estimated useful lives.  On a cycle basis,
asset lives are reviewed for propriety.  Changes in depreciation
rates, if any, are applied prospectively.

Environmental Costs -~ Environmental costs relating to cur-
rent operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate,
depending on whether such costs provide future economic
benefits.  Liabilities are recognized when the costs are consid-
ered probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Measurement
of liabilities is based on currently enacted laws and regula-
tions, existing technology and undiscounted site-specific
costs.  Such recognition occurs no later than the Company's
commitment to a formal plan of action.  Environmental liabil-
ities in connection with properties which are either sold or
closed are realized upon such sale or closure, to the extent
they are probable and estimable at that date.  In assessing envi-
ronmental liabilities, no set-off is made for potential insur-
ance recoveries.  Recognition of any joint and several liability
is made based upon the best estimate as to Shell Oil's final
pro rata share of the liability.  All liabilities are monitored and
adjusted regularly as new facts or changes in law or technolo-
gy make appropriate.

2.  Accounting Changes

  Shell Oil adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions," in 1992.  In
contrast to previous years when Shell Oil's portion of premi-
um payments was recorded as retiree health care expense and
charged against income, SFAS No. 106 requires the accrual
of the expected cost of providing retiree health care benefits
during the period the employees rendered the necessary ser-
vice to be entitled to such benefits.  Shell Oil elected to
immediately recognize the cumulative effect of adopting
SFAS No. 106 as of January 1, 1992.  As shown below, this
resulted in the recognition of an accumulated postretirement
health care benefit obligation of $950 million ($627 million
after deferred income taxes).
  Shell Oil also adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," in 1992.  This statement superseded SFAS
No. 96, which was adopted by Shell Oil in 1988.  SFAS No.
109 prescribes an asset and liability approach in accounting
for income taxes, requiring that deferred tax assets and liabil-
ities be determined using the tax rate expected to apply to
taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset
or liability is expected to be realized or settled.  Under this

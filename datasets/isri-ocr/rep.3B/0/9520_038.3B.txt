Financing Activities
In 1993, the Company issued $600 million of long-term
debt as follows: in March, $200 million of debentures due in
2023; in October, $200 million of debentures due in 2023;
and in November, $200 million of debentures due in 2003.
The proceeds of all debentures were used mainly to reduce
short-term borrowings and secure favorable long-term inter-
est rates. Interest rate swaps were utilized to obtain the
equivalent of short-term rates during the first year of the
October and November financings.
 In 1992, taking advantage of low interest rates, the
Company increased short-term borrowings by $657 million
to, in part, retire $255 million of high-rate long-term debt.
Also, in January, 9.2 million shares of common stock were 
sold in a public offering yielding $650 million, and $200
million of 7~~~% notes due in 2007 were issued. These
proceeds were principally used to retire higher rate debt
outstanding at that time.
 Net borrowings were $994 million in 1991, principally
used to finance acquisitions and large capital projects.
 Common stock dividends per share were $.42 per quar-
ter ($1.68 on an annual basis) in 1993, 1992 and 1991.
Payments were $208 million in 1993, $206 million in 1992
and $186 million in 1991.

Capital Resource Outlook for 1994
Cash flow from operations is expected to be adequate to
meet internal capital expenditures, working capital and
dividend requirements. A strong balance sheet (debt to
capital ratio of 39% in 1993, up from 38% in 1992 and com-
parable with 39% in 1991) supporting an investment-grade
debt rating allows ready access to financial markets to take
advantage of external investment and favorable financing 
opportunities.


Other Financial Statement Items
Net interest expense increased to $310 million in 1993 from
$247 million in 1992 and down from $315 million in 1991.
1992's net interest benefited from tax-related interest in-
come and higher capitalized interest related to two major
European capital projects that are now completed.
 The effective tax rate for 1993 increased to 42% (37%
before the revaluation of deferred tax balances) of pre-tax
income compared with 31% in 1992 and 37% in 1991. The
adoption of SFAS No. 109 and the tax benefit at statutory
rates of the productivity improvement and other charges in 
1992 contributed to 1992's lower rate. The increase in the 
rate for 1993 results from the increase in the U. S. statutory
federal income tax rate of 1%, which also increased deferred
taxes by $25 million.
 During 1993, the Company recognized tax benefits
amounting to $55 million related to losses at certain of its
non-U.S. operations, increasing noncurrent deferred tax
assets to $115 million at December 31, 1993. The Company
believes that it is more likely than not that these assets will
be realized.

Environmental Issues
Given the nature of its businesses, International Paper is
closely linked to the environment. Increasingly demanding
environmental laws and regulations have resulted in signifi-
cant capital spending to meet or exceed air, water and solid
waste disposal standards. Environmental capital expendi-
tures totaled  $100 million in 1993, $126 million in 1992 and
$107 million in 1991. Capital spending to increase recycling
capacity totaled $102 million, $35 million and $5 million
in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

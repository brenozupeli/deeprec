  We introduced a variety of innovative solutions in 1993. For the financial market, for instance, new solutions
include FBA Navigator, which helps banks improve the delivery of services to their customers at retail locations,
and FBA BANKview, which provides an integrated view of information scattered across a bank's diverse systems.
For the public sector market, our new LifeLine solution is the first computer-aided dispatch system for medium to
large emergency response organizations that is based on workstation and local-area network technology. Like a 


growing number of our software solutions, these 
systems are based on flexible client/server archi-
tectures designed for easy integration with other 
vendors' systems.
  To ensure we deliver truly value-added solu-
tions, we involve our clients throughout the devel-
opment process. We built FBA Navigator and FBA 
BANKview, for instance, in consultation with key 
banking partners. LifeLine reflects the input of
police chiefs and dispatchers.
  Alliances with outside industry partners are
also key to our approach. Through our alliance 
with KPMG Peat Marwick, for instance, we offer
our clients a broad base of industry expertise as
well as specific software solutions for financial
management, human resources, and process man-
ufacturing. An alliance with software provider


Information Technology, Inc., which provides a leading banking package running on our A Series systems, has
helped us win new banking, savings and loan, and credit union clients.
  In our services engagements, and in our solutions, we are making increasing use of the skills and underlying
technologies of our Government Systems Group. Joint government and commercial teams are evaluating commer-
cial projects in such potential growth areas as airport automation and fingerprint imaging. In another area, we are
working with Time Warner to evaluate applying our spread spectrum technology -~ originally used to ensure the
secure communication of information for military purposes -~ to improve the security and capability of tomorrow's
cable television networks.
  In 1994 we will continue an active expansion of our information services program. We look to build our repu-
tation as a world-class provider of information services, and continue our strong growth in this dynamic market.


The skies above the United States are the busiest in the world -~ and 
becoming busier. To handle this growing volume of traffic, the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration is partnering with Unisys on a major 
effort to upgrade the systems used to manage air traffic at the 200
largest airports. A new radar system, jointly developed by Unisys and
Westinghouse, improves aircraft surveillance and allows air traffic con-
trollers to deliver critical messages to pilots electronically, minimizing
use of busy cockpit channels. The enhanced radar system sets the new
international standard for air traffic safety. Another new system from
Unisys provides controllers a magnified, color view of parallel runways,
allowing them to handle multiple landings.

   To reach these objectives, Dow has developed a new process to identify the most promising new
concepts and bring them to market more effectively.  This development and commercialization
process begins with a raw idea and takes it all the way through its market introduction, ensuring that the
concept meets various decision criteria as it progresses toward commercialization.  A project director,
who stays with the project through its commercial launch, provides a single point of accountability.
   The new process will use the principles of accelerated development, including teamwork, that
demonstrated their effectiveness in the rapid commercialization of Insite technology (see photo page 4).
"Developing Insite technology followed a simple recipe for success," says L. Dennis McKeever, vice
president, Research and Development, for Dow North America and Dow Plastics globally.  "First, we
had a real scientific breakthrough.  In fact, it was so significant that Dow was awarded several composi-
tion of matter patents on this technology."
   The team developing Insite technology also had clear objectives and business sponsorship from
the beginning.  The development project was treated as a top priority with the optimum level of
resources being made available.  Initial market development quantities were sold quickly and full
commercialization has already begun.
   Protecting the Environment  Operational excellence and market-focused innovation come
together in the commercial application of Dow's environmental strengths.  The company's long-term
commitment to protecting the health of people and the environment has become a source of income.
Worldwide regulatory standards are becoming stricter, requiring many companies to make
investments in environmental protection equipment that Dow has already made.  Often they
require assistance in adapting to these changing standards.  As a result, Dow has found growing
demand for its expertise in preventing, separating, controlling and treating waste and for its
remediation technologies.  The company has developed a number of businesses to meet this growing
need, including Advanced Cleaning Systems and AWD Technologies (see photos on cover and page 8).
   "We know that the winners of tomorrow will be those companies that integrate environmental
issues into all of their business decisions," says David Buzzelli, Dow's vice president of Environment,
Health & Safety and Public Affairs.  "Our experience is proving it."
   Making It Happen     Dow has long recognized that while strategy points the way, people
make it happen.  In the past months, managers at every level have spent more time with employees,
working to establish a common understanding of the company's challenges, strategies and objectives.
"We are convinced that Dow people will continue to be our main source of competitive advantage,"
says Frank Popoff, Dow chairman and chief executive officer.  "They will be the force behind our
improvement."
   Dow's business environment is likely to improve as well.  Supply and demand balances for most
chemicals and plastics are slowly becoming more favorable to the company.  The result should be
gradual but sustainable gains in prices and earnings.  At the same time, the company will continue to
enhance its productivity and competitiveness.  New and recently introduced products and services
are expected to produce hundreds of millions of dollars in new sales within the next three years.
There's room for growth in many markets, especially for consumer and industrial specialties.
   So despite a disappointing performance in 1993, Dow has good reason to be confident, even though
more changes lie ahead.  "We'll join a short list of companies that can prosper under any circumstances,"
says Stavropoulos.  "We'll create our future."

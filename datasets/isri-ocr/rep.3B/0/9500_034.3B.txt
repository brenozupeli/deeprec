The schedule of principal payments on long-term debt is as
follows:

(1) Amounts are net of repurchases.


  The only material financial instruments which are not car-
ried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at amounts which
approximate fair values are certain debt instruments. The car-
rying value of long-term debt and related current maturities
(excluding capitalized lease obligations), is $1,687 and $1,906
million and the fair value is $1,945 and $2,100 million at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The fair value of
the long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market
price for the issues (if traded) or based on the current rates
offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining
maturity and characteristics.
  The Company entered into two new credit agreements (3
Year and 364 Day Credit Agreements) dated July 7, 1993, with
commitments aggregating $900 million, with a group of 21
banks. These agreements replaced a $1.11 billion arrange-
ment. The funds available under the Credit Agreements may
be used for any corporate purpose.  Loans under the $450
million 3 Year Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no
later than July 7, 1996.  Annually, the Company may request
that the maturity of the 3 Year Credit Agreement be extended
by another year.  The Company intends to request an exten-
sion of the agreement in 1994.  The banks' commitments to
lend under the $450 million 364 Day Credit Agreement termi-
nate on July 5, 1994 and any loans then outstanding will be
converted to term loans maturing on July 5, 1995. The Com-
pany intends to renegotiate this agreement in 1994. The Com-
pany has agreed to pay facility fees of .10 percent per annum
and .15 percent per annum on the aggregate commitments
for the 364 Day and 3 Year Credit Agreements, respectively,
subject to increase or decrease in the event of changes in the
Company's long-term debt ratings.  The Credit Agreements do
not contain restrictions on the Company's ability to pay divi-
dends or requirements that the Company maintain a specific
net worth.  They do contain other customary conditions and
events of default, the failure to comply with, or occurrence of
which, would prevent any further borrowings and would gen-
erally require the settlement of any outstanding borrowings
under either Credit Agreement.  Such conditions include the 
absence of any material adverse change in the ability of the
Company to pay its indebtedness when due, and such events
of default include (a) non-payment of Credit Agreement debt
and interest thereon, (b) non-compliance with the terms of
the covenants, (c) cross-default with other debt in certain
circumstances, (d) bankruptcy and (e) defaults upon obliga-
tions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
  Interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreements would
be determined, at the Company's option, by (a) an auction
bidding procedure; (b) the highest of the average floating
base rate of two reference banks, one-half percent above the
average CD rate, or one-half percent above the Federal funds
rate; or (c) .225 and .275 percent for the 3 Year and 364 Day


Credit Agreements, respectively, and if either Credit Agree-
ment is drawn down in excess of 50 percent of its total
amount, .2875 and .3375 percent for the 3 Year and 364 Day
Credit Agreements, respectively, over the average LIBOR or
CD rate of three reference banks.  The spreads over the LIBOR
or CD rates are subject to increase or decrease if the Com-
pany's long-term debt ratings change.  The Company had no
balance outstanding under the Credit Agreements at Decem-
ber 31, 1993. They have also served as support for the issu-
ance of commercial paper and certain notes under the Com-
pany's Employee Stock Ownership funding program.  At
December 31, 1993 the Company had outstanding $164 mil-
lion of commercial paper and $259 million of notes sup-
ported by the Credit Agreements.

Total                                        $485


 Rent expense of $128, $131 and $146 million was included
in costs and expenses for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Note 16. Capital Stock

The Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares
of preferred stock without par value and may establish series
of preferred stock having such number of shares and such
terms as it may determine.
  The Company is authorized to issue up to 500,000,000
shares of common stock, with a par value of one dollar.
Common shareowners are entitled to receive such dividends
as may be declared by the Board of Directors (the Board), are
entitled to one vote per share, and are entitled, in the event
of liquidation, to share ratably in all the assets of the Com-
pany which are available for distribution to the common
shareowners. Common shareowners do not have preemptive
or conversion rights. Shares of common stock issued and
outstanding or held in the treasury are not liable to further
calls or assessments.  There is no restriction on dividends or
the repurchase or redemption of common stock by the Com-
pany. The Company has remaining authority to repurchase
from time to time up to 16.5 million shares of common stock.
  Each share of common stock is accompanied by a share
purchase right (a Right) which entitles shareowners to buy
one newly issued share of common stock at an exercise price
of $150, subject to adjustment. The Rights will be exercisable
only if a person or group acquires stock representing 20
percent or more of the power to vote generally in the elec-
tion of directors (becomes an acquiring person) or announces
a tender or exchange offer which would result in such person
or group becoming an acquiring person. Upon exercise after
a person or a group becomes an acquiring person, each Right
(other than Rights held by the acquiring person) will entitle
the holder to purchase a number of shares of common stock

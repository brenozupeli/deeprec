REVIEW OF CASH FLOW  Continued


potential future expenses could be as much as  $70 million 
for these sites. Four sites in this category account for
$63 million of the accrued amount and for approximately
$60 million of the potential future expenses.
  Monsanto spent $39 million in 1993 for remediation 
of Superfund and other waste disposal sites. Most of these
expenditures related to The Chemical Group, and simi-
lar or greater amounts can be expected in future years.
  For operational facilities, Monsanto recognizes post-
closure environmental costs and site remediation costs
over the estimated remaining useful life of the related
operational facilities, not to exceed 20 years. Monsanto
spent $14 million in 1993 for remediation of these facili-
ties and has an accrued liability of $33 million as of
Dec. 31, 1993, for these sites. Uncertainties related to 
these costs are evolving government regulations, the 
method and extent of remediation, and future changes in 
technology. Monsanto's estimated closure costs for these
plant sites are approximately $150 million.
  While the ultimate costs and results of remediation of 
waste disposal sites cannot be predicted with certainty,
management believes that Monsanto's liquidity 
and profitability in any one year will not be materi-
ally affected.

Common Stock Purchase 
Program Continued

  In April 1992, Monsanto's board of directors autho-
rized the purchase of 5 million shares of Monsanto
common stock. In October 1992, the board authorized 
the purchase of an additional 12 million shares. In 1993,
Monsanto purchased 5.8 million shares at a cost of 
$380 million. Since June 1987, Monsanto has purchased 
49.6 million shares at a cost of $2,550 million.
Management believes the stock purchase program repre-
sents a sound economic investment for Monsanto's 
shareowners.


Dividends Increase for the 
21st Consecutive Year

  Monsanto has paid quarterly dividends on its common 
shares without interruption or reduction since 1928, and
has increased the dividend per share in each of the past 
21 years. Dividend payout for 1993 was 38 percent of
cash provided by operations. Monsanto's dividend policy 
reflects a desired long-term payout percentage based
on Monsanto's expectations of future growth and
profitability levels. In any individual year, additional 
consideration is given to expected financial position
and results, working and fixed capital needs, scheduled 
debt repayments, and economic conditions, includ-
ing inflation.
  Monsanto's common stock is traded principally on 
the New York Stock Exchange and is listed on other 
exchanges worldwide. The number of shareowners 
of record as of Feb. 25, 1994, was 56,044; and the
high and low common stock prices on that date were
$77~~~ and $77~~~.


~ Monsanto's dividend per share has increased 122 percent
since 1983.

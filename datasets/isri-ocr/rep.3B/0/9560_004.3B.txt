Shareowner 
Value Milestones

We achieved a 16.9 percent return on shareowners'
equity (ROE) in 1993. Excluding nonrecurring items, 
ROE would have been 15.8 percent.

Excluding nonrecurring items in both years, net 
income would have grown 33 percent in 1993 from
1992 earnings.

We increased our annual dividend to $2.32 per share 
at our annual meeting in April 1993. This was the 
21st consecutive year that Monsanto increased its 
quarterly dividend.

We repurchased 5.8 million shares of Monsanto stock in 
1993 through several authorized share repurchase plans.
From June 1987 through December 1993, we acquired 
49.6 million shares through repurchase plans and 
through ongoing compensation and benefit plans.

Total return to shareowners for Monsanto for the 
last five years exceeded that of the Standard & Poor's 
Chemicals group by 43 percent and the Standard &
Poor's 500 group by 13 percent.

We continued to establish direct links between the 
interests of our shareowners and the compensation of
our employees. In February 1993, performance stock 
options were granted to 1,200 eligible employees world-
wide. These options are tied to Monsanto's achieving 
its 20 percent ROE target.


we originally expected.
We wish it were otherwise.
However, we have been 
breaking boundaries in
research, marketing and 
regulatory arenas in this
new field. Innovation
comes at a sweet price.


But the rewards can also be sweet.
  The Chemical Group, as now aligned, has demon-
strated its increasing earnings capability even without 
much help from the worldwide economies. This is a very
strong unit. Only one or two businesses need further work
to make them full players, and we are going about that 
work now. The Chemical Group will be solid and reliable.
  NutraSweet, which was part of the G.D. Searle & Co. 
acquisition in 1985, has generated enough cash to pay for
the entire Searle acquisition and subsequent investments,
including the cost of capital. This assumes typical values 
for the current assets. In addition, NutraSweet's prospects 
have been successfully stabilized following the 1992 expi-
ration of its U.S. patent for NutraSweet brand sweetener.
  It is now time for Searle, our pharmaceutical unit, to
begin to pay its own way and secure its own future. We
have carefully studied Searle's current and emerging 
product line. We have concluded that Searle is sustainable
as a medium-size pharmaceutical company meeting cor-
porate targets, despite the realities of health care cost
containment. Our original intention when we acquired 
Searle, however, was for much more. Our job now is to
determine whether we can form alliances and related 
actions with other pharmaceutical companies that would 
result in cost savings, product gains, and a larger phar-
maceutical presence. Such alliances will be a significant
determinant in our future plans for Searle. An intense 
effort is under way to find the right partners.


A dozen years ago, no
more than 25 percent
of our assets met today's
financial target. At the 
close of 1993, the num-
ber was more than 60
percent and growing.

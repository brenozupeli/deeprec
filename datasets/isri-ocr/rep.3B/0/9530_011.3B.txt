  During the year, we began
producing gas from the Antrim, a
shale formation across much of
northern Michigan.  By employing
best practices of other producers
in the area, we were able to devel-
op this field more quickly and less
expensively than in the past with-
out compromising our high safety
and environmental standards.  We
are exploring for additional gas in
the region.
  "Enhanced" techniques are
used to produce oil that is difficult
to extract from reservoirs by pri-
mary means.  We inject steam, pri-
marily in California, to dislodge
heavy crudes.  Carbon dioxide is
injected, primarily in West Texas,
to improve the recovery of lighter
crudes.  Enhanced operations
accounted for 35 percent of net
domestic crude oil and condensate
production in 1993.
  Natural Gas - We continue to
seek opportunities to produce


and market natural gas, and are
continuing our strategy of selling
our gas to longer-term customers
who place a high value on a reli-
able and secure supply.  In sup-
port of this strategy, we obtained
storage capacity and became a
more aggressive purchaser of
third-party gas for resale.

International Operations

  In 1993, we explored and/or
produced in 12 countries outside
the United States.  International
operations accounted for about
10 percent of our net production
on a crude oil equivalent basis.
  International production of
crude oil and condensate was
61,000 barrels per day, essentially
unchanged from 1992.  Principal
production was in Syria and
Cameroon, with Syria contribut-
ing over 50 percent of our net
international crude oil and con-

densate production.  Late in
1993, we combined our Syrian
exploration and production


operations with selected explo-
ration and production holdings
of a subsidiary of Shell Petroleum
N.V. We own a 25 percent equi-
ty interest in the new company.
  A major portion of future
crude oil production outside the
United States will come from
Yemen and China.  In the Yemen-
Masila Block, where we have a 20
percent ownership interest, pro-
duction began in July 1993 at a
gross rate of 50,000 barrels per
day following completion of field
production facilities and a
pipeline and offshore loading ter-
minal.  By the end of 1993, pro-
duction had reached more than
125,000 barrels of oil per day as
additional wells were brought on
stream.  Offshore China, Shell Oil
and other working interest owners
began fabrication of platforms to
develop two oil fields in the Pearl
River Mouth Basin.  Production
from one field should begin by
late 1994, with production from
the other commencing in 1995.
  Net natural gas production
increased 39 percent to 39 mil-
lion cubic feet per day, due pri-
marily to initial production from
a platform in the Merluza Field,
offshore Brazil.  Principal produc-
tion was in New Zealand and
Syria, as well as Brazil.
  During 1993, with others, we
conducted seismic operations in
Syria, Yemen, Angola, China and
Cameroon, and drilled exploration
wells in Syria, Yemen, Angola and
Indonesia.  At year-end, explo-
ration drilling had commenced in
Bolivia.  In the coming year, we
expect to continue our exploration
efforts in these countries and to
add selected new ventures.


The Masila Block in Yemen is
one of our important new
international ventures.  Pic-
tured here is the Masila Cen-
tral production facility.  Pro-
duction began in mid-1993
and reached 125,000 barrels
of oil a day as of year-end.
Shell Oil holds a 20 percent
interest.

"We're taking forestry into the 
high-tech era. We're turning 
Rotorua into Cellulose Valley."


Rotorua-~a small-
town tourist mecca
known for its
relaxing mineral
baths and Maori carvings-~
seems an unlikely place to
launch a high-tech revolution.
But don't tell that to the scientists at
Rotorua's Forest Research
Institute. "What we're doing," 
says Dr. Kathy Horgan, one of 
the Institute's leading biotech-
nologists, "is singling out the
trees that grow the fastest, then
using genetic techniques to 
create thousands of plants from
a single seed. If you can cut the
time it takes to go from seedling
to harvest from 30 years to,
say, 25-~that can mean a huge 
difference in the economics of 
forestry. And that's precisely the
revolution we're working to 
bring about."

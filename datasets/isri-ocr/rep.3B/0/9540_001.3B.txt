President's Letter


To Our Customers, Shareholder, Employees and Friends

  CITGO had a challenging and fantastic year in 1993. It reminded me of one of my favorite CITGO
advertisements, the one that says, "First we learned to walk. Then we learned to run. Now we're ready to fly."
This past year was a mini-version of the CITGO success story told by that advertisement. The first quarter of 1993
was among the poorest earnings periods in our history - you might say we were barely walking. We picked up our 
pace in the second quarter and hit our stride in the third. By the end of 1993, CITGO had experienced its most
successful year ever. Income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was up 35 percent.
Safety performance was outstanding, coming extremely close to 1992's record. Sales of CITGO products were up,
and our refineries were safe, clean, and reliable. We continued our strategic growth trend, acquiring a 28,000 bpd
asphalt refinery in Savannah, Georgia, in April and joining forces with Houston-based Lyondell Petrochemical 
Company to form LYONDELL-CITGO Refining Company, Ltd., in July. In sum, 1993 was a very good 
year for CITGO.
  CITGO's 1993 net income of $162.1 million on revenues of $9.1 billion compared very favorably to 1992's net
income of $33.2 million on revenues of $9.2 billion - a 35 percent increase when the accounting change adopted in 
1992 is excluded. Income from operations for 1993 was $340.1 million, compared with $310.0 million in 1992.
  While our financial performance was impressive, I am equally pleased with CITGO's 1993 safety performance.
CITGO's 1993 total OSHA Recordable Incidence rate of 2.2 very nearly matched 1992's record-breaking 
performance, while the lost workday case rate of 1.2 tied our 1992 record. Both CITGO's incidence and lost
workday rates were among the best in the industry.
  But it's not the numbers I'm proud of as much as it is the people - CITGO employees - who made them possible.
Safety is not a numbers game. It is about taking the right steps, every minute of every day, to ensure that all of us
return safely to our families at the end of the day. CITGO's five-year trend of sustained safety performance is proof
positive that our safety strategy is a long-term and effective one.
  While we invested close to $100 million in 1993 on environmentally related projects, it was once again our people
who helped to "keep it clean." Through recycling, source control, pollution prevention teams, education, and 
awareness, CITGO employees fulfilled our commitment to environmental stewardship. From the manufacturing, to 
the packaging, to the transportation of our products, we are dedicated to protecting the environment.
  The past year was also highlighted by outstanding sales performances from every CITGO business unit.
Gasoline sales to distributors increased 19 percent to five billion gallons in 1993, while rack distillate and jet turbine
sales volumes rose 24 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Lubricants sales volumes to distributors were up 
5 percent over 1992 levels, despite an industry-wide decline in demand, while refined wax sales saw a record-

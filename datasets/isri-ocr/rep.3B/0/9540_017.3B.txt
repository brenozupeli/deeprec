  The Company's asphalt business enables CITGO to diversify its earnings base
while providing PDVSA an outlet for nearly 15 million barrels annually of its
extra-heavy crude. In 1993, PDVSA-CITGO synergies continued to expand as
CARCO marketed one million barrels of asphalt from PDVSA affiliate 
Lagoven in 1993.
  CARCO's refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey, ran a record-setting 11.3 million
barrels of crude, a 4.1 percent increase over 1992 levels. An emphasis on safety
earned refinery employees an NPRA Gold Award, while an environmental 
focus led to the recycling of 4.6 million pounds of solid waste into 
highway paving material.
  Employees at CARCO's headquarters in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, worked 
hand-in-hand with employees at the Savannah refinery to ensure the smooth 
incorporation of the refinery into CITGO operations at the start of the asphalt
season. Production at Savannah was excellent, as the refinery, in eight 
months of CITGO operation, ran 3.5 million barrels of crude - 96 percent 
of the total 1992 runs.
  Equally impressive was the fact that CARCO's marketing and terminal
operations realized a savings of 30 cents per barrel in asphalt terminaling and 
transportation costs, as waste elimination efforts increased and six of eleven
terminals were automated. CARCO's "Vision 94" is bright indeed, as plans 
call for automation of at least three more terminals and expansion into 
the Albany, New York, market.


Asphalt

  While a declining market 
forced many asphalt 
companies to reduce 
operations, in 1993 CITGO
Asphalt Refining Company 
(CARCO) had an 
outstanding year. Sales 
volumes jumped 36 percent 
over 1992 levels to 10.3 
million barrels of asphalt,
and CITGO's asphalt 
refineries set production 
records and achieved 
significant safety 
milestones. In May, the 
Company became the
largest asphalt producer on
the East Coast when a 
28,000 bpd asphalt refinery
in Savannah, Georgia, was 
successfully incorporated 
into CITGO operations.

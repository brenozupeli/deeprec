Liquidity - Internally generated cash, access to outside
financing based on strong credit ratings, and prudent man-
agement of working capital are the essential components of
Shell Oil's liquidity position.  Cash and cash equivalents
amounted to $1,296 million at year-end 1993, an increase of
$562 million over 1992 and $744 million over 1991.
  Shell Oil's strategy continues to rely mainly on internally
generated cash to finance routine operating requirements
and capital spending.  Short-term borrowings will generally
be used to fund interim working capital needs and unusual
requirements.  As of December 31, 1993, unused backup
credit facilities of $500 million were available for general
corporate purposes, including support of commercial notes.
The Company plans to manage the level of backup facilities
consistent with its cash and cash equivalents balances.  Dur-
ing 1993, Shell Oil redeemed all of the existing $250 million
of 8 3/8 percent Notes Due 1996 and retired $250 million
of 7 5/8 percent Notes Due 1993.  As of the end of 1993,
$500 million of a $1.0 billion  shelf registration remained,
allowing future flexibility in the markets.
  The Company utilizes financial derivatives from time to
time to manage its financial risk exposure to interest rates and
certain commodity prices.  During 1993 Shell Oil entered
into interest rate swaps related to existing long term debt.  At
December 31, 1993, the notional amount of such swaps was
$250 million with maturities extending into 1996.  In the
future, the Company may increase the level of financial deriv-
atives activities as business conditions warrant.
  Working capital at the end of 1993 increased $185 mil-
lion over a year earlier due primarily to higher cash and cash
equivalents, offset in part by lower receivables and invento-
ries.  Shell Oil's liquidity position is considerably stronger
than indicated by these working capital levels because of rel-
atively lower historical costs assigned to inventories under
LIFO accounting procedures.  The year-end inventory values


included in working capital were below their current costs by
$648 million at the end of 1993, $1,049 million in 1992
and $1,104 million in 1991.  Current assets exceeded cur-
rent liabilities by $273 million at the end of 1993, $88 mil-
lion at the end of 1992, while current liabilities exceeded
current assets by $1,262 million at the end of 1991.

Environmental Matters

  Shell Oil continues to make substantial capital and oper-
ating expenditures relating to the environment, including
expenditures associated with compliance with federal, state
and local environmental regulations.  Included within such
expenditures are costs of compliance with the various laws,
regulations and permit requirements concerning reduction
of releases into air and water and disposal and handling of
wastes at ongoing operating locations.  Also included within
such overall environmental expenditures are the costs of
remedial orders, corrective action requirements and other
cleanup obligations under federal, state and local law and by
contract both at operating locations and at previously owned
or operated properties, as well as remediation costs at off-
premises sites.
  Discussions are ongoing with governmental agencies as to
the scope and magnitude of Shell Oil's present closure and
post-closure Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) and similar state or local remediation obligations at
operating locations.  Such discussions are part of the normal
RCRA regulatory process.  Shell Oil anticipates that those
discussions will result in corrective action being required cur-
rently at its manufacturing locations.  The complexity of the
fact issues and the evolving legal requirements, coupled with
the many choices made available by diverse technologies that
may be used in such corrective action, make it difficult to
estimate with great reliability the total costs of such action.
However, Shell Oil currently estimates the costs of imple-
menting corrective action at its Martinez, California  Manu-
facturing Complex to be about $20 million, of which
approximately $16 million has been expended and the
remainder has been provided for in the accounts.  This esti-
mate is down approximately $10 million from previous esti-
mates because investigations to date have uncovered less con-
tamination than expected and more cost-effective remedia-
tion methods have been utilized.  Expenditures at Martinez
have taken place over five years with the maximum expendi-
ture in any year being about $7 million.  Corrective action at
Shell Oil's Carson Plant (part of the former Wilmington
Refinery) is expected to cost about $13 million, which
amount is also provided for in the accounts.  We are not

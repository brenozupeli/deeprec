Ore-Ida purchased two exceptional foodservice brands: Moore's, a leader
in frozen coated onion rings, vegetables and cheeses; and Domani, the 
number-two producer of frozen stuffed pastas.
 
An important domestic acquisition after the close of the fiscal year was the
purchase of Borden's Foodservice Group, which makes a wide range of
single-serve condiments, sauces and salad dressings. Heinz also has made 
key advances in its global infant feeding strategy. The company announced 
preliminary agreements to acquire Farley's infant food and milk business
in the United Kingdom and negotiations to buy Glaxo's Family Products 
Division in India.

Facilities and Procurement  Ongoing investment in facilities and training fostered continuous advances
in quality and efficiency. Improvements ranged from high-speed, automated 
equipment for the Heinz Pet Products facility in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania
to the completion and official opening of the Custom Foods plant in 
Dundalk, Ireland. Heinz Japan saw new production and packaging lines at
its Utsunomiya factory. New lines in Venezuela doubled ketchup production 
for Alimentos Heinz. Heinz Service Company began processing customer
orders utilizing advanced office and computer systems.

Heinz's procurement efforts continued to trim millions of dollars in raw 
materials costs by leveraging the company's worldwide buying power.
Punishing midwestern floods reduced the region's potato, soybean, wheat
and corn crops; Heinz's North American affiliates obtained sufficient
harvests from alternative sources.

Public Service   Heinz's worldwide affiliates continued the community service tradition 
begun by Henry J. Heinz 125 years ago. The H.J. Heinz Company 
Foundation led the way with grants totaling $6.2 million to approximately
950 organizations and matched, two-for-one, 1,360 employee contributions.

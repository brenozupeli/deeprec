M  Pension Plans and Other Postemployment Benefits
The Company has defined benefit pension plans which cover
employees in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries.  The
Company's funding policy is to contribute annually, at a rate that is
intended to approximate a level percentage of compensation for the
covered employees, to those plans where pension laws and eco-
nomics either require or encourage funding.

The U.S. funded plan is the largest plan.  Its benefits are based
on length of service and the employee's three-highest consecutive
years of compensation.  The weighted average discount rate and rate
of increase in future compensation levels used in determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations were
7.25 and 5.5 percent, respectively, for 1993 and 8.25 and 6 per-
cent, respectively, for 1992.  The assumed long-term rate of return
on assets was 9 percent for 1993 and 9 percent for 1992.

All other pension plans used assumptions in determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations that are
consistent with (but not identical to) those of the U.S. plan.

The funded status of fully funded, significant defined benefit
plans for the Company was as follows:

The net periodic pension cost for all significant defined benefit

								1993		1992		1991
Service cost-benefits earned during the period			$ 152		$ 122		$ 101

Net periodic pension cost					$ 136		$ 125		$  98


Defined contribution plans cover employees in Australia, New
Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom and some U.S. subsidiaries.
In addition, employees in the U.S. are eligible to participate in
defined contribution plans (Employee Savings Plans) by contribut-
ing a portion of their compensation.  The Company matches com-
pensation, depending on Company profit levels.  Contributions
charged to income for defined contribution plans were $92 in
1993, $98 in 1992 and $89 in 1991.

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company pro-
vides certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired
employees.  As discussed in Note A, the Company adopted FASB
Statement No. 106 effective January 1, 1992.  Previously, the
Company recognized the cost of providing these benefits as the
benefits were paid.  These pretax costs amounted to $53 in 1991.
The Company continues to fund most of the cost of these medical
and life insurance benefits in the year incurred.

The U.S. plan covering the parent company is the largest plan.
It provides medical and life insurance benefits including hospital,
physicians' services and major medical expense benefits and life
insurance benefits.  The plan provides benefits supplemental to 
Medicare after retirees are eligible for these benefits.  The cost of
these benefits are shared by the Company and the retiree, with the
Company portion increasing as the retiree has increased years of 
credited service.  The Company has the ability to change these 
benefits at any time.

Effective October 1993, the Company amended its health
benefits plan in the U.S. to cap the cost absorbed by the Company
at approximately twice the 1993 cost per person for employees who
retire after December 31, 1993.  The effect of this amendment was
to reduce the December 31, 1993 accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation by $327.  It also reduced the net periodic postre-
tirement cost by $21 for 1993 and is estimated to reduce this cost
for 1994 by approximately $83.

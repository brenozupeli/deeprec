RALSTON PURINA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

water quality, underground fuel storage tanks, and waste handling and disposal. The Company has approximately 300
underground fuel storage tanks at various locations throughout the United States which are subject to federal and state
laws and regulations establishing minimum standards for such tanks and, where necessary, remediation of associated 
contamination. The Company is presently in the process of testing and evaluating, and, if necessary, removing, replacing or
upgrading such tanks in order to comply with such laws. In addition, the Company has received notices from the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, state agencies, and/or private parties seeking contribution, that it has been identified as
a "potentially responsible party" (PRP), under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act,
and may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to approximately 19 "Superfund" sites. The Company's 
ultimate liability in connection with those sites may depend on many factors, including the volume of material contributed to
the site, the number of other PRP's and their financial viability, and the remediation methods and technology to be used.
While it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of actions involving environmental matters, particularly
remediation costs at waste disposal sites and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, in the
opinion of management, the ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters, taking into account established 
accruals for estimated liabilities, should not be material to the financial position of the Company, but could be material to
results of operations or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period.

Inflation

  Management recognizes that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on the Company through higher asset 
replacement costs and related depreciation and higher material costs. The Company tries to minimize these effects through
cost reductions and productivity improvements as well as price increases to maintain reasonable profit margins. It is 
management's view, however, that inflation has not had a significant impact on operations in the three years ended 
September 30, 1994.

Foreign Exchange

  The Company is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products in over 160 countries on a global basis. The 
Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to mitigate the Company's economic exposure to
changes in exchange rates. The Company views these exposures as arising from three major areas: (a) non-U.S. dollar
cash flows to the U.S. from foreign subsidiaries expected within a year or less, (b) cash flows to a foreign country in a 
currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency, and (c) future cash flows at the operating margin level. Contracts
are entered into to offset exposures on a net basis. The level of such actions is dependent on seasonality of the Company's
activities and on specific market conditions involving various currencies. See Commitments and Contingencies note to
financial statements for additional information about foreign currency contracts.

  The Company generally views as long-term its investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other
than the U.S. dollar. As a result, the company does not generally hedge these net investments. However, the Company uses
capital structuring techniques to manage net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary. Additionally, the
Company attempts to limit its U.S. dollar net monetary liabilities in currencies of hyperinflationary countries primarily in
South America. Net foreign investments as of September 30, 1994 were:

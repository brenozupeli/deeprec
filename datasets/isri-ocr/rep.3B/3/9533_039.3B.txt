Financial Services
Revenue Recognition
Financial Services revenues are recognized generally on the
accrual method, except that revenues for real estate accounts are
being recognized only as payments are received.
  When accrual method accounts become delinquent for more
than two payment periods, usually 60 days, income is recog-
nized only as payments are received.  Such delinquent accounts
and all real estate accounts for which no payments are received


in the current month, and other accounts on which income is
not being recognized because the receipt of either principal or
interest is questionable, are classified as nonearning receivables.

Investment Tax Credit
The investment tax credit earned prior to its repeal on property
leased to others has been deferred and is recognized as income
over the contractual terms of the respective leases.

Portfolio investments by category of investment and financing

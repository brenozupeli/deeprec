In promoting productivity, we are doing more than simply singling out manufacturing. We are challenging each of 
our people to uncover new ways to "produce more" and to "produce better." By making fuller use of our "intellec-
tual capital," we are working to bring better products to market faster, to produce higher-quality products at lower
cost and to market these products more efficiently.

To accomplish this broad agenda, we are taking a fresh look at everything we do. We are then re-engineering what
we find in need of change. One center of change is global purchasing. Our new global sourcing strategies should
enable us to deliver a total of $100 million in cost savings within the next few years. 

In the pharmaceutical marketing arena, we have substantially revised the way we bring our product messages to
the medical community. By streamlining how we sell pharmaceuticals, we are serving our customers better while 
substantially reducing the cost of reaching medical professionals.

At Warner-Lambert we recognize how important it is to be responsive to the ever-changing needs and expectations
of our customers. Thanks to our customer orientation, we are continually searching for new ideas that will make

that sets products apart. Our pharmaceutical customers demand value that permits them to deliver quality health
care at reasonable cost. Likewise, consumers increasingly expect exceptional product value. Warner-Lambert's 
productivity and quality programs are enabling the company to deliver enhanced product value.

Superior product value has become a guiding principle of new product development. We have placed our phar-
maceutical research dollars squarely behind compounds we firmly believe capable of producing a large health care
dividend. Our research focuses on such conditions as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke and bacterial infection.
The following compounds, all in advanced stages of human evaluation, reinforce our confidence in the strength of
our research program.

defect that causes this disease. By contrast, existing clinical evidence suggests that troglitazone treats this cellular

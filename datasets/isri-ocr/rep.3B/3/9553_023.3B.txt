Stock participation plan. Under this plan, qualified employees may
purchase shares of Intel's Common Stock at 85% of fair market
value at specific, predetermined dates. Of the 59.0 million shares
authorized to be issued under the plan, 15.4 million shares are
available for issuance at December 31, 1994. Employees purchased 
2.0 million shares in 1994 (2.2 million and 2.6 million in 1993 and 
1992, respectively) for $94 million ($71 million and $57 million in 
1993 and 1992, respectively).
Retirement plans. The Company provides profit-sharing retirement
plans (the "Profit-Sharing Plans") for the benefit of qualified
employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The plans are designed to
provide employees with an accumulation of funds at retirement
and provide for annual discretionary contributions to trust funds.
The Company also provides a non-qualified profit-sharing retire-
ment plan (the "Non-Qualified Plan") for the benefit of qualified 
employees in the U.S. This plan is designed to permit certain
discretionary employer contributions in excess of the tax limits
applicable to the profit-sharing retirement plans discussed above
and to permit certain employee deferrals in excess of certain tax
limits. This plan is intended to be an unfunded plan.
  The Company accrued $152 million for the Profit-Sharing Plans 
and the Non-Qualified Plan in 1994 ($103 million in 1993 and
$93 million in 1992). Of the $152 million accrued in 1994, the 
Company expects to fund approximately $126 million for the 1994 
contribution to the Profit-Sharing Plans and to allocate approxi-
mately $5 million for the Non-Qualified Plan. The remainder, plus
approximately $120 million carried forward from prior years, is
expected to be contributed to these plans when allowable under
IRS regulations and plan rules.
  Contributions made by the Company vest based on the employ-
ee's years of service. Vesting begins after three years of service in
20% annual increments until the employee is 100% vested after
seven years.
  The Company provides qualified defined benefit pension plans
for the benefit of qualified employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
Each plan provides for minimum pension benefits, which are de-
termined by a participant's years of service, final average compen-
sation (taking into account the participant's social security wage
base), and the value of the Company's contributions, plus earnings,
in the Profit-Sharing Plan. If the balance in the participant's Profit-
Sharing Plan exceeds the pension guarantee, the participant will
receive benefits from the Profit-Sharing Plan only. Intel's funding
policy is consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws
and regulations.

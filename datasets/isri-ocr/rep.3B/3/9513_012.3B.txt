Ford Motor Company


Usually, change happens because
someone's imagination is put to
practical use.  The team at right,


Robert Van Oel (far right),
Denise Mitchell and Stuart
Oke, was honored with a Henry
Ford Technology Award last
year.  The three developed a
new support apparatus for
headlamps that allows much
greater flexibility in vehicle
design.  It was used on the 
1993 Ford Ranger and 1994
Ford Mustang and will


be on future 
vehicles.  Inset:
Though small, the
team's invention,
shown next to a 
headlamp, has
had a big impact
on design.


Ford in


1993 began selling


North American-built vehicles
in China.  There now are 10 independently franchised


dealerships, including this one in Shanghai, where visitors take
a close look at a Lincoln Town Car.  Ford's North-American built exports


to all markets totaled 71,000 in 1993, up 42 percent from 1992.


Movie audiences worldwide saw Ford Explorers,
alongside actors Richard Attenborough and
Laura Dern, tangle with genetically engineered
dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park," the highest-
grossing movie ever.


The Ford-sponsored "Visiones del
Pueblo:  The Folk Art of Latin 
America" is the first major traveling
exhibit of its kind and gives young
artists like these a chance to show
off their skills.  In 1993, Ford was
selected Corporation of the Year by
both the United States Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce and the
Michigan Hispanic Chamber of 
Commerce.


At the Auto Safety
Center (above) in
Dearborn, Mich.,
engineers direct a crash
dummy headform at
targets in a vehicle
interior.  An impactor at
the end of a robotic arm
fires the headform at
speeds up to 15 mph to
gather data.  This test is
aimed at increasing
occupant safety.


All 1994 Ford Motor
Company cars and light
trucks, excluding daily
rental fleet units, include
free roadside assistance.


Drivers can call a toll-free,
nationwide hotline any time, any


day.  The program is sponsored by Ford Credit's Ford
Auto Club and administered by The Associates, both
units of Ford's Financial Services Group.  Inset:
Customer service representatives such as Rosa Gonzales
will arrange roadside service or contact local police or
public safety officials at the driver's request.

National Recreation
Area, Tenn., as a
backdrop.  Aspire is the
least expensive vehicle
sold in North America
with standard dual
air bags.

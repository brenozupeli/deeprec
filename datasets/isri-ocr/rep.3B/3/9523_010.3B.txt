BIOTECHNOLOGY AT MERCK


Historically, Merck has
been a leader in the dis-
covery and development of
breakthrough therapies for
important human diseases,
including hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and
bacterial infections.  Today,
Merck remains in the
forefront of fundamental
applied biotechnology
to elucidate disease
mechanisms and identify
biochemical targets for
therapeutic intervention.
  Merck's success in bio-
technology dates back to
1986 when Recombivax HB
became the first genet-
ically engineered vaccine
for human use.  Skillfully
applying recombinant
DNA technology, in 1989
Merck researchers were
the first to identify the
HIV-1 protease enzyme as
an important target for
AIDS therapy and solve
the three-dimensional
structure of the enzyme
produced by the virus.
In 1993, Merck's protease
inhibitor entered early
clinical trials.
  Merck scientists inte-
grate biotechnology,
molecular biology, high
resolution nuclear mag-
netic resonance, X-ray
crystallography and molec-
ular modeling to identify
and characterize the pro-
teins associated with a dis-
ease.  They then focus on
the next critical step -~ to
discover small molecules


that affect these proteins
and possess the character-
istics of a pharmaceutical
agent. As an example,
Merck is moving beyond
the usual focus of biotech-
nology in the treatment
of human growth hormone
deficiency. The current
therapy is recombinant
human growth hormone,
administered by injection.
Merck researchers have
identified small molecules


termed growth hormone
secretagogues that induce
the release of natural
growth hormone.  Such
compounds may have
application in the treat-
ment of growth hormone
deficiency in children and
adults, burn patients,
patients with bone fractures
and the frail elderly.
  The powerful tools
of biotechnology are com-
bined with Merck's exper-


tise in drug discovery in
projects throughout our
global laboratories.  Areas
of research include cardio-
vascular disease, nervous
system disorders, oph-
thalmic disease, bone dis-
ease, respiratory diseases,
inflammation, dermatol-
ogy, obstetrics, cancer,
obesity, diabetes, infectious
diseases, vaccines and
metabolic disorders.


AIDS RESEARCH
One of the targets for AIDS therapy is the protease enzyme.  Merck is studying an inhibitor of the enzyme which is now in
early clinical trials.  William Schleif, Senior Research Associate, Antiviral Research at West Point, Pa., studies a sample
of the inhibited HIV-1 protease.

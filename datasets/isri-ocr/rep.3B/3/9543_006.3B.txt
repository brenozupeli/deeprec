PERFORMANCES OF CONTINUING BUSINESSES IMPROVED

In the Electrical Products segment, high levels of indus-
trial production, a strong homebuilding market and
improving nonresidential construction bolstered sales 
growth of electrical protection equipment, lighting fixtures
and power distribution products. Several successful prod-
uct introductions and product-line acquisitions also 
increased revenues. The favorable effects of higher sales
were offset somewhat by the cost of facility consolidations, 
competitive conditions in some markets, delayed funding
for airport renovation projects and the cost of several
new-product launchings.
  Sales of hand and power tools continued to benefit 
from strong residential construction and industrial produc-
tion. Recent product-line acquisitions also aided revenues 
of the Tools & Hardware segment, which were 11% higher 
than in 1993. Demand for our tools in international markets
improved slightly from 1993 levels. Competitive conditions
in window treatment markets somewhat offset the otherwise
strong performance of the segment. Nevertheless, operating
earnings for the segment increased by 12% as a result of 
higher revenues and cost controls. Earnings for this seg-
ment should continue to benefit from additional facility
rationalizations and the integration of acquisitions.
  Revenues for the Automotive Products segment were
relatively unchanged from the year before but began to 
strengthen during the fourth quarter. Higher domestic 
sales to original equipment manufacturers followed strong 
car and truck production activity here in North America.
The improvement in the domestic market was offset by 
weak demand for spark plugs and wiper products in 
Europe and Latin America and extremely competitive 
industry pricing conditions in aftermarket brakes. Oper-
ating earnings for the segment remained steady at 1993's 
level; however, the segment's return on sales increased sig-
nificantly, providing evidence that our ongoing programs
to improve the efficiency of the Automotive Products 
operations are working.


SENIOR MANAGEMENT CHANGES AND AN 
ADDITION TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Cooper Industries has long been known for its depth of
management and its ability to attract, develop and retain
strong managers.
  Larry McCurdy, who was President of Moog 
Automotive when it was acquired in 1992, joined the corpo-
rate management team in April as Executive Vice President.
He is responsible for the Automotive Products segment.
  In May, Dewain Cross, Senior Vice President of
Finance since 1980, announced his intention to retire at
the end of April 1995. He has served Cooper for more than 
27 years. He will be succeeded by Brad McWilliams, a 23-
year veteran of Cooper, who has been promoted from Vice 
President of Taxes and Real Estate to Vice President, 
Finance. Dan Leightman, Executive Director of Taxes,
was named Vice President, Taxes; and Joe Chamberlain
was promoted to Controller, Accounting.
  Bill Brewer, an engineer by training who had been 
President of Cooper Power Systems Division, moved to 
the corporate office in July to take over as Vice President
of Manufacturing Services.
  Vice Chairman Alan Riedel retired in April after 34 
years of service to the Company -~ 31 years as an officer
and 13 years as a member of the Board. He was an inte-
gral part of building Cooper from $68 million in revenues 
in 1960 to more than $4.6 billion last year. Our law, 
human resources and public affairs functions evolved 
under his leadership, as did our system of management
development. His sound judgment, personal integrity 
and respect for others are discernible in the policies that
guide the administration and public relationships of the
Company and have helped to make Cooper the strong
company it is today.
  In August, Harvard Business School Associate 
Professor Linda Hill was elected a Director. Her expertise 
is in organizational behavior and human resource 
management.

TIMOPTIC-XE (timolol maleate
ophthalmic gel-forming solution)
A new once-a-day formulation
of our beta blocker Timoptic for
treatment of elevated intraocular
pressure associated with glaucoma.
It has been launched in the United
States and cleared for marketing in
Germany, Denmark, Sweden,
Mexico, Brazil and New Zealand.
A preservative-free formulation of
Timoptic-XE is under development
for patients with allergies and for
post-surgical hospital use.

COZAAR (losartan potassium)
Cozaar, which is being tested as a
once-daily therapy for treatment
of high blood pressure and heart
failure, is the first of a new class
of drugs called angiotensin II
receptor antagonists.  Results from
completed Phase III trials for
hypertension indicate Cozaar pro-
duces antihypertensive benefits
comparable to those seen with
angiotensin converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors.  Cozaar may avoid
or reduce certain side effects expe-
rienced by some patients taking
ACE inhibitors.  Applications to
treat heart failure await the comple-
tion of further clinical trials.
  Marketing applications were
submitted to the U.S. Food & Drug
Administration (F.D.A.) and to
some other countries in 1993 for
Cozaar as monotherapy for hyper-
tension. An application was also
submitted in the United States for
Hyzaar, a combination of losartan
potassium with the diuretic
hydrochlorothiazide, for treatment
of hypertension.  Cozaar is
being developed in collaboration
with The Du Pont Merck
Pharmaceutical Company.


  ROXIAM (remoxipride)
In late 1993, Merck withdrew from
review by the F.D.A. its New Drug
Application (N.D.A.) for Roxiam for
the treatment of acute and chronic
schizophrenia, following eight
reports of aplastic anemia in patients
treated with the drug in Europe.
Roxiam, a discovery of AB Astra of
Sweden, was being developed by the
Astra/Merck Group, which markets
Astra products licensed to Merck in
the United States.


TRUSOPT (dorzolamide
hydrochloride)
The first topical carbonic anhydrase
inhibitor for treatment of elevated
intraocular pressure associated with
glaucoma.  In clinical trials, Trusopt
does not appear to have cardiovas-
cular or pulmonary side effects
associated with oral carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors and has no
effect on visual acuity as does
pilocarpine.  Trusopt should be an
important single therapy for
patients for whom beta blockers
are inappropriate and also may be
an important add-on therapy for
patients requiring two medications
to control intraocular pressure.
Applications were submitted to the
F.D.A. in the United States and to
certain other countries in 1993.
Trusopt will also be developed in
combination with Timoptic, our
existing glaucoma medication, for
patients with elevated intraocular
pressure associated with the
disease.

VARIVAX
A live attenuated vaccine for the
prevention of chickenpox.  More
than 9,000 healthy children and
1,500 healthy adolescents and
adults have been vaccinated in var-
ious clinical trials.  Results in one
study showed that 97 percent of
healthy children developed protec-
tive antibodies against chickenpox
after a single dose of the vaccine.
In another study, 99 percent of
healthy adolescents and adults
developed protective antibodies
after two doses.  In January 1994,
the F.D.A.'s External Advisory
Committee on Biologics favorably
reviewed Varivax.  Varivax was
developed using the Oka strain of
the varicella virus licensed from the
Biken Institute at Osaka University
in Japan.

PEPCID AC (famotidine)
An N.D.A. was filed with the F.D.A.
in 1993 for an over-the-counter
formulation of famotidine, Merck's
gastrointestinal drug.


FOSAMAX (alendronate sodium)
A specific and potent oral amino-
bisphosphonate that inhibits osteo-
clast-mediated bone resorption.
Fosamax is in Phase III clinical
trials for treatment and prevention
of osteoporosis and Paget's dis-
ease.  In total, approximately 10,000
women worldwide are participating
in clinical studies with Fosamax.
Two-year data from a three-year
treatment study indicate Fosamax
increased bone mineral density of
the spine and hip compared with
placebo-treated patients whose
bone mineral density decreased.
An ongoing four-year study, the
largest trial of osteoporosis ever
conducted to evaluate Fosamax in
prevention of bone fractures,
involves 6,000 women ages 55-80.
Fosamax was cleared for marketing
in Italy in 1993 for treatment of
post-menopausal osteoporosis.
Regulatory filings in other coun-
tries are planned in 1994 and in the
United States in 1995.  Fosamax is
licensed to Merck by the Istituto
Gentili in Italy.

VAQTA
A highly purified vaccine for the
prevention of hepatitis A infection.
Hepatitis A infection of the liver is
spread through contaminated food
or water.  Vaqta has been tested in
clinical studies involving more than
6,000 people.  A single dose of the
vaccine has been shown to induce
a high level of protective antibodies
in more than 98 percent of recipi-
ents ages 2 to 16 after only three
weeks.  Clinical trials are ongoing.
The U.S. Product License
Application is planned for 1994.

MK-476
An oral leukotriene D4 (LTD4)
receptor antagonist.  For the treat-
ment and prevention of chronic
asthma, including nocturnal asthma
and asthma induced by exercise
and aspirin.  An intravenous
formulation is also in development.
It is anticipated that MK-476 as a
once-daily oral therapy should
show significant therapeutic
advantages over inhaled steroids,
theophylline and beta agonists,
with fewer side effects.


MK-462
A serotonin 5-HT1D receptor ago-
nist with good oral bioavailability
for the treatment of migraine and
associated symptoms.

HIV-PROTEASE INHIBITOR
Blocks viral replication in cell
culture.  Data from early clinical
studies show that this compound
does have an antiviral effect but
that the virus may be developing
resistance.  Phase II testing will
continue using higher doses of the
protease inhibitor as well as com-
binations of the protease inhibitor
with other anti-HIV agents.

MK-499
An orally active, potent and highly
selective potassium channel
blocker.  In development as a
Class III antiarrhythmic for 
ventricular and atrial arrhythmias.

MK-383
Fibrinogen receptor antagonist for
intravenous use.  Being developed
for treatment of cardiovascular
disorders in which platelet
aggregation is implicated, such
as unstable angina pectoris.

ENACARD (enalapril maleate)
For the treatment of heart failure
in dogs.  Enalapril maleate is the
active ingredient in our human
health product Vasotec.  Enacard
has been cleared for marketing
in the United States, the United
Kingdom, Ireland, Australia,
Canada and The Netherlands with
registrations pending in Japan
and Italy.

MK-324
For the control of flea and tick
infestation in dogs.  It is a second
generation avermectin. Now in
large-scale clinical trials.

MK-244
An analog of avermectin for the
control of lepidopteran pests on
high value vegetable crops,
such as cabbage, corn, lettuce and
tomatoes.  Now in large-scale
field trials.

Intel in the community
 
Kids in this third-grade Seattle class were among the thousands participating in the Intel-sponsored chess
instruction programs and championships in schools around the country.


To teach kids
how computers
work, Intel
launched "The
Journey Inside,"
a national edu-


cation program


for grades 5 to 9.
The program consists


of hands-on learning


materials for teachers and


students that come in a box


shaped like a PC (shown left)


and "The Journey Inside" IMAX 
feature film now showing at
theaters around the world.


Intel provided $1 million in Pentium 
processors to Arkenstone, a nonprofit 
organization that helps the visually im-
paired "read" using voice synthesizers.
Here, second-grade teacher Mike Jones,
who is blind, uses a voice synthesizer
to read a book of children's poems.


Intel works


hard to protect the environment


and to be sensitive and responsive to any
community concerns. At Intel's New Mexico site,
Intel managers, community members and state
environmental officials gathered in August to cele-
brate the opening of three new thermal oxidizers,
installed to eliminate the solvent odors that some
neighbors complained about. For more on Intel's 
environmental initiatives around the world, readers

Safety annual report by calling 1-800-548-4725.

ENHANCING DRUG
DISCOVERY


The Merck Research
Laboratories are com-
mitted to expanding the
frontiers of medical
science and improving
public health.  In an
environment of mount-
ing pressures to contain
health-care costs, we
believe that continued
investment in research
is key to improving the
quality and value of
health care.  Our lead-
ership position in the
pharmaceutical indus-
try is based upon the
fruits of our research
investment, because
research is the path to
improving the practice
of medicine.  On the
following pages, we de-
scribe efforts to enhance
the drug discovery and
development process,
early programs in new
therapeutic areas and
key product candidates
in clinical development.


We continue to improve
the research infrastructure
to support and expand
our drug discovery and
development efforts.
  Increasingly, the
research process is being
automated.  Sophisticated
robots handle sampling
and routine testing on a
24-hour-per-day basis,
greatly increasing research
productivity and freeing
Merck scientists to explore
innovative research.


Nucleic acid and protein
sequencers and synthe-
sizers make it possible to 
achieve in hours what once
took weeks or months.
The rational approach to
drug discovery is identify-
ing biochemical targets
and modeling chemical
entities that may bind
with them.  Our sources for
new chemical leads
include biologically diverse
natural products and large
predictable libraries of
synthetic compounds.
These are screened in high
volume, specific and


extremely sensitive tests
for activity against disease
targets.  Powerful desktop
work stations provide
scientists the means to
analyze volumes of data,
conduct literature searches
from their laboratories,
and communicate data
and documents across
our networks to Merck
scientists worldwide.
  Our new Bioinformatics
Group is charged with the
determination, dissemina-
tion, understanding and
utilization of the tremen-
dous volume of nucleotide
and protein sequence
information being generat-
ed by the scientific com-
munity.  This group will
bring state-of-the-art
computational biology
expertise to all levels of
the drug discovery process
within Merck.
  Merck is developing a
unique, fully integrated,
worldwide computer sys-
tem for tracking clinical,
statistical and regulatory
processes.  This system will
improve timeliness and
quality of clinical data
collection, provide better
communication of world-
wide clinical development
activities and increase our
capacity to accommodate
larger and more complex
clinical projects.


EVALUATING NEW ASTHMA DRUG
Margaret Seibold, R.N. (r.), of the Princeton Allergy and Asthma Associates,
P.A., in New Jersey, discusses results of a spirometry test with patient
Marthaliese Dixon, who took part in a clinical study of Merck's new product
candidate for asthma.  The incidence of asthma is increasing around the world.
In the United States alone, hospitalizations for asthma have doubled for adults
and increased fivefold for children in the last 20 years.

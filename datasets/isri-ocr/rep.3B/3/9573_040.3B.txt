accordingly, continue to be carried at amortized cost.  At

ized gains were $.4 and $4.3. Gross unrealized losses
were $4.0 at December 31, 1994.  The investment securi-
ties portfolio was comprised of negotiable certificates of
deposit, Puerto Rico government bonds, guaranteed collat-
eralized mortgage obligations and Ginnie Mae certificates,

rized as "available-for-sale," were immaterial.

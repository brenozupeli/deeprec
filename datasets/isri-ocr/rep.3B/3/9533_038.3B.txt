NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


  The reserve for the estimated loss on the disposal of
Discontinued Operations established in November 1992 con-
sisted of an addition to the valuation allowance for Financial
Services portfolios, estimated future results of operations and
sales proceeds to be obtained from Discontinued Operations,
as well as estimates as to the timing of the divestitures and
assumptions regarding other relevant factors.
  During 1993, the Corporation reviewed its estimates of
proceeds from the disposal of Discontinued Operations and the
operating income or loss that would be generated by these busi-
nesses during their disposal periods.  Through the third quarter
of 1993, the Corporation had favorable experience with the sale
of Financial Services assets, selling them at prices in excess of
original estimates and on a more accelerated schedule than was
anticipated at the time the Plan was developed.  The more rapid
liquidation of the assets had the effect of reducing the earned
income from the Financial Services assets during the disposal
period, which, to a large degree, offset the favorable price expe-
rience from the asset sales.  In addition, the marketing process
for Other Operations indicated that expected proceeds would
be less than the initial forecast.  Through the third quarter of
1993, all of these factors were reviewed and considered to be
largely offsetting.
  In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Corporation recorded
an additional provision for loss on disposal of Discontinued
Operations of $148 million, pre-tax or $95 million, after-tax.
This change in the estimated loss resulted from additional
information, obtained through negotiation activity, regarding
the expected selling prices of WESCO and the Australian sub-
sidiary of DCBU.  Also contributing to this provision was a
decision to bulk sell a Financial Services residential develop-
ment that the Corporation, upon adoption of the Plan, had
intended to transfer to WCI for development.  These matters
and a revision to the estimated interest costs expected to be
incurred by the Discontinued Operations during the disposal
period resulted in the additional fourth quarter provision.
  The reserve for the estimated loss on the disposal of Discon-
tinued Operations may require adjustment in future periods to
reflect changes in any of the above constituent elements, which
may be affected by adverse economic, market or other factors
beyond what was anticipated at December 31, 1993.
  Management has considered all of the above factors and
believes that the reserve for the estimated loss on disposal of
Discontinued Operations should be adequate.  The adequacy of
this reserve is evaluated each quarter, and the actual experience
and any changes in expectations will be considered in determin-
ing whether adjustment to the reserve is required.
  In accordance with APB 30, the consolidated financial state-
ments reflect the operating results of Discontinued Operations
separately from Continuing Operations.  Prior periods have
been restated.  Summarized operating results of Discontinued

Chairman's Letter to Shareholders


  Sustainable growth in the 1990s is
dependent on an organization's
ability to evolve simultaneously
with its markets, or even to drive
that evolution.  In 1994, the Company
made substantial progress toward this
goal, building on the efforts of the past
several years.

Improved trends in operating earnings
(before restructuring charges) for each
of the core businesses in the RPG Group
demonstrate the efficacy of initiatives to
reshape business processes.  At the same
time, restructuring charges in our bat-
tery business, and declining results in the
CBG Group, are reminders that dramatic
changes and challenges are an on-going
phenomenon.

During 1994, we made a significant
structural change intended to move the
Company closer to its markets, increase
the focus of operations, and thereby
improve profitability and shareholder
returns.  Effective April 1, 1994, a new
company, Ralcorp Holdings, Inc., con-
sisting of Ralston's private label and
branded cereal businesses, Beech-Nut
baby food, Bremner Crackers, and ski
and resort businesses was formed and
spun-off tax free to Ralston shareholders.

Most recently, on November 15, 1994,
Ralston signed a letter of intent to sell
our international agribusiness operations
to PM Holdings Corporation, the parent
company of Purina Mills, Inc. The trans-
action is subject to necessary approvals
and the completion of a definitive sales
agreement.  Our international pet food
and cereal operations are not included in
the sale.

Due to the complexity generated by
Fiscal 1994 transactions, it is most useful
to discuss Ralston Purina Group results
for the year on a pro forma basis
(excluding results of spun-off businesses,
restructuring charges and other unusual
items).  A financial overview and recon-
ciliation of the pro forma results to the
financial statements immediately follows
this letter.


Ralston Purina
Group Results

For the year, RPG Group's pro forma
sales and net earnings before restructur-
ing charges were $5,236,200,000 and
$266,400,000, respectively, compared
to $5,024,300,000 and $277,300,000
in 1993.  Pro forma earnings per share for
the year were $2.48 and $2.37 on a pri-
mary and fully diluted basis, respectively,
compared to $2.50 and $2.38.  The
decrease in pro forma results was driven
by a $.25 per primary share decrease
in earnings related to the RPG Group's
retained interest in the CBG Group,
partially offset by higher operating
earnings.

Operating profit for domestic pet foods
was flat as higher volumes were offset by
higher ingredient costs.  Operating profit
for international pet foods improved on
higher volumes.

Battery Products' operating profit, exclu-
sive of restructuring charges, increased
for the year on significantly higher
domestic results and inclusion of
rechargeable operations acquired in
August 1993, partially offset by contin-
ued declines in Europe.  Domestic
increases were driven by improved alka-
line volume.  European operations
declined on an unfavorable product
mix, significant declines in carbon zinc
volume and increased costs associated
with launching of the Energizer brand to
supplant existing alkaline brands.
Unadjusted operating profit for Battery
Products was down due to charges
related to restructuring of the worldwide
carbon zinc operations.

Operating profit for the Protein business
improved on increased volumes partially
offset by higher raw materials costs and
unfavorable foreign currency exchange
rates.  International Agricultural Products
profit was down slightly due to volume
declines in Europe, partially offset by
improvements in Asia and the Americas.


Continental Baking
Group Results

CBG Group's sales and net loss
for 1994 were $1,948,600,000 and
$27,400,000, respectively, compared to
$1,997,000,000 and $57,500,000 in
1993.  The net loss in 1994 includes a
restructuring charge of $9,600,000 and
an extraordinary loss from early debt
retirement of $1,600,000.  The 1993 net
loss included charges for accounting
changes of $86,600,000 and an extraor-
dinary loss from early debt retirement of
$1,900,000.

Loss per share before charges for the
year was $.48 on a primary and fully
diluted basis, compared to pro forma
earnings per share before charges of
$.77 and $.67, respectively, in 1993.  The
net loss for 1994 was $.78 per share on
a primary and fully diluted basis versus
losses of $1.58 and $1.43 in 1993.

Operating profit of the CBG Group
declined on lower volume and unfavor-
able product mix in bread, lower thrift
store volume and higher ingredient,
production and distribution costs.

appears on page 49, immediately follow-
ing the CBG Group section of this report.

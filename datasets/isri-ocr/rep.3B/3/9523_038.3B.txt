which reduced Net income by $29.6 million on an after-tax
basis.  The effect of this change on 1992 Income before
cumulative effect of accounting changes was not material.
  In May 1993, Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, was issued which
requires adoption in 1994.  This Statement requires certain
investments in debt and equity securities to be reported at
fair value.  The effects on the Company's results are not
expected to be material.
  The Company believes that it is in compliance in all
material respects with applicable environmental laws and
regulations.  The Company has maintained a leadership
role in supporting environmental initiatives and fostering
pollution prevention by actions including the elimination of,
or the application of best available technology to, air
emissions of known or suspect carcinogens at its facilities
worldwide and a project currently underway to reduce all
environmental releases of toxic chemicals by 90% by 1995.
In 1993, the Company incurred capital expenditures of
approximately $122.4 million for environmental control
facilities.  Capital expenditures for this purpose are forecasted
to exceed $400.0 million for the years 1994 through 1998.
In addition, the Company's operating and maintenance
expenditures for pollution control were approximately $40.0
million in 1993.  Expenditures for this purpose for the years
1994 through 1998 are forecasted to exceed $200.0 million.
The Company is a party to a number of proceedings brought
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund, as well as under other Federal and state statutes.
While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of
these proceedings, management does not believe that they
should ultimately result in a materially adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations, liquidity
or capital resources.  The Company is also remediating
environmental contamination resulting from past industrial
activity at certain of its sites.  Expenditures for environmental
purposes were $26.3 million in 1993, and are estimated at
$170.0 million for the years 1994 through 1998.  The Company
has taken an active role in identifying and providing for these
costs; and, therefore, management does not believe that these
expenditures should ultimately result in a materially adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations, liquidity or capital resources.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
In 1993, capital expenditures were $1.0 billion compared to
$1.1 billion in 1992.  Expenditures in the United States were
$759.7 million in 1993 and $784.0 million in 1992.  Expenditures
during 1993 included $260.1 million for research and
development facilities, $218.5 million for production facilities,
$136.5 million for safety and environmental projects and


$397.6 million for administrative and general site projects.
Not included above are capital expenditures incurred by the
Company's joint ventures, which totalled $79.3 million in 1993,
including $14.9 million for research and development
facilities.
  Capital authorizations in 1993 were $710.8 million, a
decrease of 32% from 1992's level of $1.0 billion.  Capital
expenditures approved but not yet spent at December 31, 1993,
were $640.5 million.  These commitments include invest-
ments in research and development facilities ($124.0 million),
production facilities ($105.8 million), safety and environ-
mental projects ($82.1 million) and administrative and general
site projects ($328.6 million).
  Depreciation was $348.4 million in 1993 and $290.3 million
in 1992, of which $237.7 million and $201.4 million, respectively,
applied to locations in the United States.

ANALYSIS OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash provided by operations continues to be the Company's
primary source of funds to finance operating needs and
capital expenditures.  In 1993, net cash flows from operating
activities were $3.0 billion, reflecting the continued growth
of the Company's after-tax earnings.  This cash was used to
fund capital expenditures of $1.0 billion, to pay Company
dividends of $1.2 billion and to partially fund the purchase of
treasury shares.  At December 31, 1993, the total of worldwide
cash and investments was $3.3 billion, including $1.5 billion in
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and $1.8
billion of long-term investments.  The above totals include
$895.8 million in cash and investments held by Banyu
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., in which the Company has a
50.87% ownership interest.

  In 1993, working capital and the ratios of total debt to
total liabilities and equity and cash provided by operations
to total debt were impacted by the acquisition of Medco.  In
November 1993, the Company acquired all the outstanding
shares of Medco for approximately $6.6 billion.  The
Company issued $4.2 billion of equity securities and paid
$2.4 billion in cash, of which $1.8 billion was financed with
commercial paper and $250.0 million was financed with
long-term debt.

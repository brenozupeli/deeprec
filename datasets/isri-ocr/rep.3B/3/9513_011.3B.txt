Ford Motor Company


Typically, vehicle launch teams work from engineering centers with just a few
key people at the plant site.  But for the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique,
a 180-member team, including 40 Ford engineers from England and Germany,
moved to Kansas City to supervise the launch from prototype stage through
the first production car to acceleration of the assembly rate.  Shown are 10
members of the team, identified on page 50.

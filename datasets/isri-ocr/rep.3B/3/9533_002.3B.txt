TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS


The Westinghouse Electric Corporation has experienced
a tumultuous four years.  In that time we have had four
chairmen.  We have liquidated one major business and
divested two others (representing about 23 percent of our
1993 revenue), and incurred writeoffs of over $5 billion.
We have seen our core earnings decline by nearly 20 percent,
and reduced employment by 15 percent.  Consequently,
there is a high degree of uncertainty among shareholders,
customers, employees, suppliers and financial institutions.
  I came to Westinghouse as an outsider.  Frankly, after all
I had read about the company, I expected to find a hopeless
mess.  But after rigorously analyzing every Westinghouse
business, issue and opportunity, I was very pleasantly


surprised.  The
facts are that
Westinghouse has
significant strengths
and promising
opportunities.
  We have every-


thing it takes to achieve success in highly competitive, global
businesses.  Yet we must be more hard-nosed, more pene-
trating and more persistent in pursuing demanding goals.
  Our strategy for moving smartly ahead is simple, straight-
forward and achievable.
  First, we're going to focus on the handful of businesses
we know best.  We are or can be number one or number two
in the market in these businesses, although they may not all
appear to be high-growth in a macroeconomic sense.  These
are Power Generation, our turbine-generator business;
Thermo King, our transport temperature control business;
Broadcasting; Electronic Systems, our defense electronics
business; Energy Systems, our nuclear power business;
Government and Environmental Services; and The Knoll
Group, our furniture business.


Second, we are simply going to run these businesses
better and more intensely than at any time in the past.
I'm not saying we've run them badly; in fact, we've been
largely successful.  But going forward, all of our people will
be searching intensely for improvement opportunities in
cost, product features and competitive position.  To meet
our goals, these good businesses have to become out-
standing ones, with leadership in financial performance.  All
Westinghouse employees-~85,000 people-~are committed
to that end.
  Finally, we are going to run the total corporation in
a hands-on, informal fashion, blending initiative and
corporate perspective with speed of response and decision-
making.  We're going to have a significantly smaller corpo-
rate center that's actively involved in supporting our
businesses.  We're going to identify problems early, resolve
them fast, and marshal our people and investment resources


to grow the entire
corporation.
  Here are some
of the details of
what we are doing
to become stronger
and to build share-
holder value.
  We will continue


to rebuild our total financial strength.  Last year, our financial
exposure to the commercial real estate market was virtually
eliminated, reducing our net debt by more than $3.2 billion.
Our borrowings against our revolving credit facility-~which
were $5.5 billion in 1992-~are down to $1.3 billion as
of February 1994.
  The planned sale or liquidation of non-core businesses is
on schedule.  The distribution and control business was sold
for $1.1 billion in cash in late January.  In February, the


"WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON
THE HANDFUL OF BUSINESSES WE
KNOW BEST.  WE ARE OR CAN BE
NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO


IN THE MARKET IN THESE BUSINESSES ... TO MEET OUR GOALS, THESE
GOOD BUSINESSES HAVE TO BECOME OUTSTANDING ONES, WITH


LEADERSHIP IN FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE ... WE ARE SIMPLY
GOING TO RUN THESE BUSINESSES
BETTER AND MORE INTENSELY
THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE PAST."

A COLLECTION OF WINNING BRANDS

ach day, Warner-Lambert products touch millions of lives. The company's goal, as one of today's premier mar-
keters, is to enable them to touch millions more.

This goal seems achievable, given the powerful position many of these brands already hold. Warner-Lambert's
top brands have indeed done well. Some have risen to become virtual marketing icons. The most successful are
emerging today as global megabrands, products with an image so powerful that they can cross into an expand-
ing range of geographic markets and product categories. In total, 22 brands marketed by Warner-Lambert now
rank among the top three products in their respective market categories in the U.S.

Warner-Lambert intends to further leverage these brands by nurturing their development around the world. 
Above all else, it will work nonstop to guarantee that its brands are perfectly in step with evolving consumer
needs. This will allow the company to lead rather than react to marketplace change.

Warner-Lambert also will make certain that its branded products-~both consumer and pharmaceutical-~set the
standard for value. Consistently good value will always take precedence over low price at Warner-Lambert. That
is because building the value of company brands represents the surest path to enhanced shareholder value.

In the final analysis, the brands marketed by Warner-Lambert will succeed simply because they are designed not
just to meet consumer expectations but to exceed them. This quality will continue to facilitate Warner-Lambert's
mission of brand expansion around the world.

The company regards its major brands among its most prized assets. As such, the company intends to defend
them tenaciously from competitive challenge at every turn. It will work to unleash their full global potential
and to make them the kind of brands consumers can trust. The product portfolio that follows represents a 
partial collection of Warner-Lambert's leading brands.

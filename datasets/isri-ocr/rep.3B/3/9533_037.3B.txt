1993 WESTINGHOUSE ANNUAL REPORT


Changes in Accounting Principles
In December 1993, the Corporation adopted, retroactive to
January 1, 1993, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." This statement requires employers to adopt accrual
accounting for workers' compensation, salary continuation,
medical and life insurance continuation, severance benefits and
disability benefits provided to former or inactive employees
after employment but before retirement.  See note 4 to the
financial statements.
  Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation adopted SFAS
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," on the immediate recognition basis.
This statement requires that the expected costs of providing
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits be
accrued during the employees' service with the Corporation.
The Corporation's previous practice was to expense these costs
as incurred.  See note 4 to the financial statements.
  In the first quarter of 1992, the Corporation adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
This statement replaced SFAS No. 96, which the Corporation
previously used to account for income taxes.  SFAS No. 109
permitted the Corporation to recognize certain deferred tax
benefits not recognized under SFAS No. 96.  See note 5 to the
financial statements.
  In December 1992, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 107,
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments."  This
statement is an extension of SFAS No. 105, "Disclosure of
Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-
Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of
Credit Risk," adopted in a prior year, and requires the disclosure
of the fair value of certain financial instruments.  See note 22 to
the financial statements.

NOTE 2:  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In November 1992, the Corporation announced the Plan that
included exiting the financial services business through the
disposition of its asset portfolios and the sale of other non-
strategic businesses.  The Plan provided for the sale of real estate
and corporate finance portfolios over a three-year period and
the run-off of the leasing portfolio over a longer period of time
in accordance with contractual terms.  Also, as part of the Plan,
the Corporation was to divest the following other non-strategic
operations:  DCBU and WESCO; Knoll; and WCI.  Financial
Services and Other Operations have been accounted for as
discontinued operations in accordance with APB 30.
  In January 1994, the Corporation announced that the
planned sale of WCI will be accelerated from 1995 into 1994
and Knoll is no longer for sale.  With respect to Knoll, the Cor-
poration's strategy will now be directed to create shareholder
value by continuing to operate this business.


  As a result of the adoption of the Plan, the Corporation
recorded in Discontinued Operations, during the fourth quarter
of 1992, a pre-tax charge of $2,201 million.  This pre-tax charge
consisted of $2,350 million for an addition to the valuation
allowance for Financial Services portfolios, $300 million for esti-
mated losses from operations for Financial Services during the
phase-out period and $144 million for restructuring charges
related to the change in corporate strategy.  These charges were
partially offset by an estimated $449 million gain from the dis-
position of Other Operations and an estimated $144 million of
earnings from those operations during the phase-out period.
Income tax benefits totalling $818 million were recorded in
connection with the Plan.  The after-tax estimated loss on the
disposal of Discontinued Operations was $1,383 million.  A
$36 million charge for corporate restructuring was recorded in
Continuing Operations in connection with the Plan.
  In November 1992, in determining the valuation provision
for Financial Services real estate portfolio, management used
the Derived Investment Value (DIV) method.  DIV is the
process developed by the Resolution Trust Corporation for use
in measuring the values of real estate owned and loans secured
by income-producing assets and land.  In developing the provi-
sion for Financial Services corporate and leasing portfolios,
management used various techniques which considered a num-
ber of factors, including trading desk values with respect to the
corporate portfolio, and information provided by independent
consultants.  Trading desk values arise from actual or proposed
current trades of identical or similar assets.  These valuation
processes provided portfolio valuations that reflect the strategy
of exiting the financial services business.  Under the Corpora-
tion's previous strategy of downsizing Financial Services over a
period of up to five years and holding certain assets for the long
term, the methods used to value assets resulted in higher asset
values net of valuation allowances.
  The estimated gain from the disposition of Other Operations
was determined by management using various techniques and
assumptions which considered, among other factors, index
multiples derived for comparable businesses as appropriately
adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the businesses within
Other Operations.
  Variances from estimates which may occur will be considered
in determining if an adjustment of the estimated loss on disposal
of Discontinued Operations is necessary.
  Since adoption of the Plan, the Corporation has made
significant progress in disposing of Financial Services assets.
  On August 11, 1993, the Corporation announced an agree-
ment to sell the majority of DCBU to Eaton Corporation for a
purchase price of $1.1 billion and the assumption by the buyer
of certain liabilities.  The Corporation completed this sale on
January 31, 1994.
  On February 16, 1994, the Corporation announced an agree-
ment to sell WESCO to an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier &
Rice, Inc., a private investment firm, for a purchase price of
approximately $340 million.  The Corporation completed this
sale on February 28, 1994.

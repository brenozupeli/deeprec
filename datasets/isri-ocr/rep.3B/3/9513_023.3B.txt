New Accounting Standards
In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 112 ("SFAS 112"), "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits," which requires companies to account
for employee benefits on an accrual basis for periods when
employees are no longer actively employed but have not yet
reached retirement.  The effect on the company's financial state-
ments was not material.

In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan."  The standard requires that
impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate.
The company does not plan to adopt this standard until
January 1, 1995, and the effect is not expected to be material.

In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  The standard
establishes financial accounting and reporting requirements for
investments in equity securities (excluding those accounted for
under the equity method and investments in consolidated
subsidiaries) that have readily determinable fair values and for all
investments in debt securities.  The company has adopted this
standard effective January 1, 1994, and the effect is not expected 
to be material.


MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY


Management is responsible for the preparation of the company's
financial statements and the other financial information in this
report.  This responsibility includes maintaining the integrity and
objectivity of the financial records and the presentation of the
company's financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

The company maintains an internal control structure intended
to provide, among other things, reasonable assurance that its
records include the transactions of its operations in all material
respects and to provide protection against significant misuse or
loss of company assets.  The internal control structure is supported
by a staff of internal auditors who employ thorough auditing
programs, by careful selection and training of financial manage-
ment personnel, and by written procedures that communicate the
details of the internal control structure to the company's world-
wide activities.

The company's financial statements have been audited by
Coopers & Lybrand, independent certified public accountants.
Their audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which included consideration of the company's


internal control structure.  The Report of Independent Accoun-
tants appears on page 43.

The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee
composed solely of directors who are not employees of the
company, is responsible for determining that management fulfills
its responsibilities in the preparation of financial statements and
the financial control of operations.  The Audit Committee
appoints the independent accountants, subject to ratification by
the stockholders.  It meets regularly with management, internal
auditors, and independent accountants.  The independent
accountants have full and free access to the Audit Committee and
meet with it to discuss their audit work, the company's internal
controls, and financial reporting matters.

reporting the use of leaded materials and wastes. The 
Sparta plant also received a 1994 Environmental 
Achievement Award from the Tennessee Association of
Business. The TAB uses an independent panel of judges
to select a few manufacturers for recognition in the areas
of air quality, water quality, solid waste management and 
hazardous waste management.

SUPPORTING EDUCATION-IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS

Using charitable grants as a means of recognizing out-
standing citizenship is not new to Cooper. The environ-
mental awards program patterns itself after two other,
successful Cooper corporate citizenship programs -~ 
Project PACE and the Volunteer Spirit Awards program.
  Project PACE, which provides annual, $10,000 
challenge grants to public, secondary vocational-technical
schools in our plant communities, is in its sixth year.
Twenty-five schools participated in the program in 1994
and competed for the first-place award of $25,000. The 
winner was the Charles D. Owen High School in Black 
Mountain, North Carolina, where a Bussmann Division 
plant manufactures electrical fuses. The award recog-
nized the school's leadership in preparing students for
the school-to-work transition through a blend of class-
room and work-based learning experiences.


OUTSTANDING VOLUNTEERS ARE EVERYWHERE

For the past 11 years, Cooper has taken great pride in
recognizing employees who are outstanding volunteers 
in their communities. The Company expanded its
awards program last year to include employees at all of
its international locations. In 1994, Cooper recognized 
33 volunteers in eight countries, enabling them to direct
cash contributions totaling $46,000 to the nonprofit 
organizations of their choice.
  Two employees at our international locations 
received first-place awards. Senior Chargehand Fitter
John Harrison, who works for Bussmann in the U.K., was
recognized for leading an effort to pay for badly needed
repairs to a 14th century church in Leicestershire. 
Gabriel Jimenez, production manager for Cooper Lighting
in Baja California, was recognized for his many selfless
actions and dedicated service to the Oasis Del Ni~~o
orphanage in Mexicali.
  Programs like those mentioned here encourage our
managers and employees to take an active role in helping
to foster a better quality of life in our communities 
around the world.


Finding a substitute for leaded glass in the manufacture of miniature
auto lamps and reducing the high costs associated with the use of this
environmentally restricted material earned the Wagner lighting plant 
in Tennessee one of Cooper's first Environmental Excellence Awards.


Toddlers at this orphanage in Mexico found a friend in Gabriel Jimenez,
production manager for Iluminaci~~n Cooper de las Californias in
Mexicali, and a top international winner in Cooper's 1994 Volunteer 
Spirit Awards program.

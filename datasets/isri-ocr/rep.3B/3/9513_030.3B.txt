NOTE 2.  MARKETABLE AND OTHER SECURITIES

Automotive.  Automotive marketable securities are recorded at
cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.

Financial Services.  Investments in debt securities are recorded at
amortized cost because of the ability to hold such securities until


maturity and the intent to hold them for the foreseeable future.  If
market conditions change, however, certain of these securities may
be sold prior to maturity.  Marketable equity securities are
recorded at fair value.

Investments in debt securities at December 31 were as follows (in
millions):

The fair value of most securities was estimated based on quoted
market prices for those securities.  For those securities for which
there were no quoted market prices, the estimate of fair value was
based on similar types of securities that are traded in the market.

The book value and fair value of investments in debt securities at


December 31, by contractual maturity, are shown below (in
millions).  Expected maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without penalty.


								1993				1992
							Book		Fair		Book		Fair
							Value		Value		Value		Value
Due in one year or less					$   96		$   96		$  280		$  281
Due after one year through five years			 1,023		 1,035		 1,119		 1,126
Due after five years through ten years			   563		   580		   434		   443
Due after ten years					 1,477		 1,508		   715		   732
Mortgage-backed securities (including derivatives)	 2,588		 2,545		 1,851		 1,728

  Total							$5,747		$5,764		$4,399		$4,310


Proceeds from sales of investments in debt securities were
$11.2 billion in 1993, $10.5 billion in 1992 and $13.9 billion in
1991.  In 1993, gross gains of $113 million and gross losses of
$20 million were realized on those sales; gross gains of
$142 million and gross losses of $86 million were realized in
1992, and gross gains of $141 million and gross losses of
$22 million were realized in 1991.

Investments in securities other than debt securities totaled
$2,472 million at December 31, 1993, and $2,475 million at


December 31, 1992.  The estimated fair value in excess of book
value of those securities which were practicable to value was
$59 million at December 31, 1993, and $2 million at
December 31, 1992.  It was not practicable to calculate the fair
value of certain securities totaling $660 million at
December 31, 1993, and $740 million at December 31, 1992,
because they represented preferred stocks of non-traded companies
with whom the company does business and for which similar
market-traded securities were not available for comparison.

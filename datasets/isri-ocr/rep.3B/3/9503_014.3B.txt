  ADM's specialty proteins are helping meet a growing demand not only for 
basic nutrition in developing nations, but for more healthy eating patterns in
developed nations such as the U.S. Soy isolates and concentrates are helping
extend and improve meat and milk supplies around the world, from Mexico to
Moscow to Kiev.
  Isolates and concentrates are also the primary ingredients in the NutriBev~~
milk alternative and dry Harvest Burger~~ mix.  During the past year we shipped
large quantities of these highly nutritional items to countries such as Armenia, the
Ukraine and South Africa. NutriBev~~ has the same nutritional value as milk, but
can be produced lactose-free, an important consideration for much of the world's
population.  Like Harvest Burger~~, this powdered beverage offers long shelf life
and tasty convenience to consumers.
  On the domestic front, the Harvest Burger~~ plant is being greatly expanded to
meet the sales growth stemming from a marketing agreement with Pillsbury's
Green Giant Division.  Under this agreement, we process the ingredients into pat-
ties, which Green Giant markets at retail.  We are continuing to develop markets
for dry Harvest Burger~~ mix in the U.S. and for sales into the food service arena,
to include hospitals, restaurants, institutions and fast food outlets.
  The USDA's new school lunch regulations will soon make it possible for school
districts to be reimbursed for using 100% soy products such as Harvest Burger~~.
In addition, schools will be required to reduce average fat levels in meals.  A num-
ber of reduced-fat products contain ADM soy isolates.  ADM's soy products are
thus well positioned as extenders or as stand-alone products.  Before the new regu-
lations were announced, ADM provided testimony on the benefits of soy protein
at a number of USDA hearings.  We have put increased emphasis on soy protein
research.  We are also isolating some of the components in soy that are said by
many scientists to inhibit cancer and some types of diabetes.  In Europe, we have
introduced a special line of low-nitrite products for the infant formula producers.
  In Europe, British Arkady and a number of related companies are manufactur-
ing specialty products.  Soy-based ingredients-~including soy flour, soy isolates,
TVP~~ and soybean oil-~can form part of an ingredient system tailored to cus-
tomer requirements by British Arkady.
  Another soy-based ADM ingredient contributing to better nutrition and func-
tionality is lecithin.  Besides being cholesterol-free and high in polyunsaturated
fats, lecithin functions uniquely in a range of applications from emulsifying to
instantizing.  Newly expanded capacity will allow ADM to continue the rapid
growth of a modified lecithin product line.

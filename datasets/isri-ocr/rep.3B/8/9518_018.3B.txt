I. Financial Instruments:

 The following methods and assumptions are used in
estimating the fair value of each class of the Company's financial
instruments at December 25, 1993:
 
 For cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying amount
is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short-term
nature of these instruments.

 For securities included in other assets, fair value is based
upon quoted market prices for these or similar securities. The
carrying amount approximates fair value for these securities.

The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated
by discounting the future cash outlays associated with each debt
instrument using interest rates currently available to the 
Company for debt issues with similar terms and remaining
maturities.

 The estimated fair values of IBP's financial instruments as of
December 25, 1993, are as follows:


                      Carrying               Fair
(In thousands)        Amount                 Value
Long-term debt:
 Current portion      $177                   $177
 Noncurrent portion   460,723                522,695


J. Commitments and Contingencies:

 IBP is involved in numerous disputes incident to the
ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management,
any liability for which provision has not been made relative to 
the various lawsuits, claims and administrative proceedings
pending against IBP, including that described below, will not
have a material adverse effect on its financial position.

 A complaint filed against IBP in April 1988 by the Depart-
ment of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, in the United States
District Court in Kansas seeks injunctive relief and back wages,
plus interest, for certain hourly employees of the Company. The
case relates to compensation allegedly due for incidental 
activities of hourly employees before and after regular working
hours. In the liability phase of the case, the district judge has
ruled that IBP is required to pay back wages for a portion of the 
incidental activities. An appeal by the Company is in progress.
The Company's management believes it has made adequate 
provision for any liability, the amount of which, if any, will be 
determined at a later time.

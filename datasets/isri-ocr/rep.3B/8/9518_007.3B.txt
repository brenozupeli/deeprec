resources have been expended for
employee training and medical manage-
ment programs, as well as improvements
in equipment design and workplace layout.
As a result, employees at IBP have a safer
work environment and IBP's cost of 
manufacturing is less.

New Board Members

 Dr. Wendy Lee Gramm and JoAnn
Doke Smith joined IBP's Board of Direc-
tors in 1993.

 Gramm has chaired the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, served as
Administrator for Information and 
Regulatory Affairs at the White House Office
of Management and Budget and directed
the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of
Economics.

 Smith is a former Assistant Secretary for
Marketing and Inspection Services for the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture and has 
served in numerous capacities in the
livestock industry, including President of
the National Cattlemen's Association.

 We suffered the loss of a great friend
and associate in January, 1994. Perry V.
Haines, IBP Executive Vice President and
Board member, died from cancer. We will


not forget him. His picture is on the back
inside cover of this report.
 
The Future

Our goal in 1994 is to build on our
momentum. That means expanding our
plants, adding new ones and adding more
value to our list of high quality products.

 We are confident and excited about the 
future of our Company and the changes


within the 
industry. We
believe we are
well prepared and
well positioned to
extend our
tradition of
achievement
throughout the


1990s and beyond. We fully intend to
remain on the cutting edge of the meat
industry.

Chairman, President and C.E.O.

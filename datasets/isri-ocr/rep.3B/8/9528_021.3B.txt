rebound in the third and fourth quarters.
  The third-quarter introduction of Select
Lights helped the Winston brand increase one
full share point and generate considerable
incremental volume in the fourth quarter.
  Select and the Winston brand family con-
ducted highly successful "relationship market-
ing" programs in 1993. Special offers carefully
aligned to Winston smokers' interests -~ the
Winston Winners Club and Winston Week-
ends promotions -~ let Reynolds efficiently
add value to the brand, without the "scatter-
shot" approach some traditional cigarette
marketing programs have used.
  Camel Special Lights' introduction in the
second quarter also helped retain full-price
smokers for R.J. Reynolds, with its specific
formulation designed to appeal to the taste
preferences of smokers of competing brands.
Camel benefited from strong advertising and
promotions, particularly Camel Cash, a
branded-merchandise program which draws
more than 30 percent of its participants from
competitive brands -~ smokers who switched
to Camel to participate in the program.  The
program increases the equity of the brand's
image and drives volume more efficiently than
many other forms of promotion.
  In October, the Camel brand began its first
sponsorship of motorsports racing teams.
The "Smokin' Joe's Racing" teams will extend
the brand's equity among racing fans, who


demonstrate extraordinary brand loyalty to race
sponsors.  Via its highly successful Winston
Cup sponsorship, Winston has long benefited
from this brand loyalty among racing fans.
  The Winston Select, Camel Cash and
motorsports racing teams programs are
examples of the highly efficient, cost-
effective, focused marketing approaches that
Reynolds will emphasize in the future for its
full-price brands.
  In 1993, R.J. Reynolds remained a leader in
the savings segment of the market.  Reynolds's
share of the savings segment declined in the
second half of the year as the company strove
to increase margins in the category.
  Several other efforts already underway in
1993 will pay off for the company long-term.
One was the installation of MARLIN, a market-
based research tool that provides accurate,
store-by-store scanner data linked to sales and
promotions.  By identifying which retail offers
and promotional vehicles work best, MARLIN
will maximize the cost-effectiveness of every
marketing and sales dollar.
  R.J. Reynolds has long had an outstanding
sales force.  In 1993, mindful of the need to
rationalize costs, the company streamlined
the sales force -~ revamping reporting, sys-
tems, offices, and administrative functions.
The effort reduced costs without sacrificing
customer service.


International Tobacco: Growth Business, Growth Industry

  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International's full-year net sales rose 9 percent and operating company
contribution increased 12 percent compared to 1992.  Volume for the year increased 21 percent
with gains in most markets.  Operating profit margin increased 3 percent and returns on invest-
ment also rose substantially.
  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International markets three of the top-10 international brands: Camel,
Winston and Salem.  Three factors drove performance in 1993: solid performance by the com-
pany's international brands; incremental growth in important development markets; and returns
from investments in emerging and newly accessed markets, particularly Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union.

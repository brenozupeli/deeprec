Service & Support 
Systems


Government Services, head-
quartered in Cherry Hill, New
Jersey, provides technical and
engineering services in support of
other former GE Aerospace units
and U.S. Government customers,
including the Department of 
Defense, NASA, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration and other agencies.

Government Services provides 
range support at key defense instal-
lations, including the Fort Irwin
National Training Center, the
Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training 
Facility and Tyndall Air Force Base. 
Government Services' most recent 
award in this area is for operation and
maintenance services at the Air Force's 
Pacific Alaskan Range Complex.

This unit also provides development 
support for Air Force computer sim-
ulation training and operation and
maintenance and field support for
the Navy's shipboard Surveillance 
Towed Array Sensor System. In 


1992, Navy contracts were awarded 
for combat system and fleet service 
engineering and for integration 
system support for a new Japanese
destroyer construction program.

For NASA's Johnson Space Center,
Government Services supports pro-
grams such as Spacelab Life Sci-
ences, Space Station Freedom and
the joint U.S. Space Shuttle/Russian
Mir Space Station mission. For 
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Cen-
ter, Government Services develops 
small, unmanned payloads such as
Hitchhiker and the new Small
Explorer class of spacecraft. Govern-
ment Services also operates satellite
control centers for a variety of NASA
and NOAA spacecraft.

Building on the success of an aerial
radar system used by the U.S. Cus-
toms Service for drug interdiction,
Government Services received a 
contract in 1992 to supply the Air
Force with four similar systems.

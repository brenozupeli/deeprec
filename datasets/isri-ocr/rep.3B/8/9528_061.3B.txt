NOTE 14 ~ RETIREMENT BENEFITS

  RJRN sponsors a number of non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most U.S. and certain for-
eign employees.  Plans covering regular full-time employees in the tobacco operations as well as the majority of
salaried employees in the corporate groups and food operations to provide pension benefits that are based on
credits, determined by age, earned throughout an employee's service and final average compensation before
retirement.  Plan benefits are offered as lump sum or annuity options.  Plans covering hourly as well as certain
salaried employees in the corporate groups and food operations provide pension benefits that are based on the
employee's length of service and final average compensation before retirement.  RJRN's policy is to fund the cost
of current service benefits and past service cost over periods not exceeding 30 years to the extent that such costs
are currently tax deductible.  Additionally,  RJRN participates in several multi-employer and other defined contribu-
tion plans, which provide benefits to certain of RJRN's union employees.  Employees in foreign countries who are
not U.S. citizens are covered by various post-employment benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to
be defined benefit plans for accounting purposes.
  A summary of the components of pension expense for RJRN-sponsored plans follows:

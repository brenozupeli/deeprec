similar to those in private 
industry.
  Work continued for the 
Department of Justice and
the Immigration and Natu-
ralization Service to expand 
the scope of the Systematic 
Alien Verification of Entitle-
ment program, which will
give private industry on-line
access for verifying alien resi-
dent registration and entitle-
ment status. Martin Marietta
will expand the pilot pro-
gram in 1994.
  The Department of Labor 
used the Corporation's pro-
fessional services and data 
processing support to ex-
pand its UI-Internet System,
allowing each state access to
information on unemploy-
ment benefit claims. Martin
Marietta also continues its
work for the Department of
Agriculture, whose system
collects and analyzes agricul-
tural information from the 
national headquarters and 
45 state statistical offices.
  Martin Marietta is the 
prime contractor for the 
National Test Facility, a com-
plex supercomputing and
simulation resource used to
support strategic and theater
defense planning. Under di-
rection of the Air Force, the
Test Facility was linked to the
Martin Marietta-operated 
Theater Air Command and


Control Simulation Facility
at Kirtland Air Force Base,
New Mexico, providing sup-
port for testing theater mis-
sile defense concepts. The
Test Facility also was con-
nected to the Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency's Dis-
tributed Simulation Internet,
bringing the simulation re-
source program nationwide.
  Key to Martin Marietta's 
simulation success is its fam-
ily of Compu-Scene~~ technol-
ogy products. Compu-Scene
VI was purchased in 1993 by 
the Marine Corps for use in
helicopter pilot training.
Other Martin Marietta
image-generator systems are
being developed for Navy


and Marine Corps fixed-
wing, helicopter and tilt-
rotor aircraft training.
  In 1993, Martin Marietta 
was awarded contracts to 
provide armor-training sys-
tems in the Middle East and 
Europe, including crew gun-
nery trainers and driver
trainers for M-60, M-48 and
Leopard tanks, and state-of-
the-art M1A2 Platoon Gun-
nery Trainers and Tank 
Driver Trainers. Martin 
Marietta's Fort Knox, Ken-
tucky, Driver Training Facil-
ity features a unique network
for consolidating and track-
ing individual student per-


formance. Platoon Gunnery
Trainers are fully networked 
individual crew stations that 
can be used for tactical team
training or as individual 
crew trainers.
  Martin Marietta delivered
20 full-motion M1 tank train-
ing systems to the Army and 
replicated the integrated 
commander/gunner display 
station for the M1A2 main
battle tank.

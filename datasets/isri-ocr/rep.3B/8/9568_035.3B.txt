  While settlement of the terminated portions of the
FSD contract has not been finalized with the U.S. Gov-
ernment, Textron believes that its share of cumulative 
losses on the FSD contract is not likely to exceed the 
amounts previously recorded.

1992 vs. 1991

The Aircraft segment's revenues and income increased in 
1992 by $265.3 million (21%) and $15.3 million
(14%), respectively, due to the inclusion of the operat-
ing results of Cessna's manufacturing operations for 10
months in 1992, partially offset by lower revenues and
income at Bell Helicopter.
  Bell Helicopter's revenues decreased significantly in 
its non-U.S. Government business due to market soft-
ness and decreased to a lesser degree in its U.S. Govern-
ment business. Bell's income decreased primarily as a
result of the lower revenues, the effect in 1991 of a 
favorable LIFO inventory reserve adjustment (resulting
from a reduction in LIFO inventories) and the effect of 
the new accounting method relative to postretirement 
benefits other than pensions, partially offset by the ben-
efit of a lower provision in 1992 ($10 million vs. $45 
million in 1991) for cost increases on the V-22 FSD 
contract and other loss provisions in 1991.

Automotive 
1993 vs. 1992

The Automotive segment's revenues increased $389.1 
million (50%) in 1993 primarily as a result of the inclu-
sion of the operating results of Textron Acustar Plastics
for eight months, higher automotive production and a 
broader market penetration of automotive interior prod-
ucts. Income increased $22.1 million (34%), due to the
higher revenues, partially offset by a special warranty
provision and provisions for restructuring costs of $7
million.

1992 vs. 1991

The Automotive segment's revenues increased $110.3 
million (16%) over the 1991 level primarily as a result
of broader market penetration of automotive interior
products. Income increased $15.6 million (31%), due to 
the higher revenues, partially offset by higher start-up
costs on new programs and plants.


Industrial
1993 vs. 1992

The Industrial segment's revenues increased $82.1 mil-
lion (7%) and income increased $8.6 million (8%). Rev-
enues increased due to growth in the outdoor products 
and fasteners businesses. Income increased as a result of 
the higher volume, partially offset by provisions for 
restructuring costs of $9 million.

1992 vs. 1991

The Industrial segment's revenues increased $77.3 mil-
lion (7%) and income increased $17.4 million (20%).
Revenues increased in all businesses -~ outdoor prod-
ucts, fasteners and diversified products. Income 
increased primarily as a result of the higher volume,
improved manufacturing performance and a gain on the 
sale of the Forest City Tool woodworking tool business, 
partially offset by an increase in 1992 in the provision
for environmental remediation costs.

Systems and Components
1993 vs. 1992

The Systems and Components segment's revenues 
decreased $283.2 million (13%) and income decreased 
$57.1 million (31%), reflecting the weakness in the 
commercial aerospace industry, reduction in defense 
spending and the wind down of certain U.S. Govern-
ment contracts. Income decreased, due primarily to the
reduction in volume, provisions for legal matters and a 
gain in 1992 on the sale of the Textron Filtration Sys-
tems division. Provisions for restructuring costs were at 
approximately the same level in each year.
  Textron Lycoming Turbine Engine, the major line of
business in this segment, reported higher income, 
despite lower revenues. Its income increased as a result
of (a) a cumulative adjustment recorded in 1993 to 
reflect an increase in the estimated profit margin
(reflecting the benefit of reductions in overhead, includ-
ing a reduction in costs relative to postretirement bene-
fits) on a long-term contract for turbine engines used on 
the Abrams main battle tank compared with a cumula-
tive adjustment recorded in 1992 to reflect a decrease in
the estimated profit margin on that contract and (b) a 
higher level of commercial engine and overhaul sales. 
Revenues decreased at this division due to reduced ship-
ments of turbine engines for the Abrams tank and lower 
sales of other military engines.
  Excluding the effects of provisions for legal matters 
and restructuring costs in 1993 (which aggregated 
$31 million) and provisions for restructuring costs in 
1992 ($14 million), revenues and income at the other 
divisions in this segment decreased principally at 
Textron Defense Systems, Airfoil Textron, Textron
Lycoming Reciprocating Engine and Textron Specialty
Materials. At Textron Defense Systems, revenues and 
income decreased due to the benefit in 1992 of an equi-

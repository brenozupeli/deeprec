employees, at not less than the fair market value on the date of
grant.  These options generally become exercisable over varying
periods, based on continued employment, and generally expire
ten years after the grant date.  The 1990 Plan permits the granting
of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, and stock
appreciation rights.
  The 1987 Plan permits the granting of nonstatutory options
to certain officers of the Company to purchase Apple common


stock at prices not less than 75% of the fair market value on the
date of grant.  Options under the 1987 Plan are generally not exer-
cisable for 18 months after the date of grant, and then become
exercisable at varying rates over the subsequent seven years,
based on continued service to the Company.
  Summarized information regarding the Company's stock
option plans as of September 30, 1994, is as follows:

Restricted Stock Plan

On April 1, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors approved
a Restricted Stock Plan for officers of the Company (the RSP),
which became effective July 1, 1993.  The RSP was subsequently
ratified by the shareholders on January 26, 1994.  The RSP is
designed to provide an incentive for officers to continue to own
shares of the Company's common stock acquired upon exercise
of options under any of the Company's Stock Option Plans, thus
more closely aligning officers' financial interests with those of the
shareholders.  The RSP provides that officers who exercise stock
options and continue to hold the exercised shares for at least
three years will receive up to three Awards of shares of restricted
stock.  Each such Award is for one-third the number of shares
held for the requisite retention period.  Each restricted stock
Award granted pursuant to the plan becomes fully vested three
years after the grant date, provided that the officer maintains
continuous employment with the Company and that other
vesting requirements are met.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the
Purchase Plan) under which substantially all employees may
purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price
equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the
beginning or end of the offering period.  Stock purchases under
the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's compen-
sation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year.  As of
September 30, 1994, approximately 1 million shares were
reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.


Stock Repurchase Programs

In November 1992, the Board of Directors authorized the
purchase of up to 10 million shares of the Company's common
stock in the open market.  No shares were repurchased under this
authorization in 1994, while approximately 3.4 million shares
were repurchased under this authorization in 1993.  In September
1990, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to
10 million shares of the Company's common stock in the open
market.  During 1993 and 1992, the Company repurchased the
remaining shares under this authorization, which approximated
to 1.6 million and 4.0 million shares, respectively.

Savings Plan

The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan)
that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Under the Savings Plan,
participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pretax
earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution
limit ($9,240 for calendar year 1994).  Effective July 1, 1994, the
Company matches 30% to 70% of each employee's contributions,
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the
employee's earnings.  Prior to July 1, 1994, the Company matched
30% to 50% of each employee's contributions, depending on
length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earn-
ings.  The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan
were approximately $10.7 million in 1994 and $11.1 million in
each of 1993 and 1992.

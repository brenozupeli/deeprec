Properties and Depreciation   Property, plant and equip-
ment, including capital leases, are carried at cost, including
interest cost capitalized during construction on significant
capital programs.
  Depreciation and amortization of properties are computed
over estimated service lives generally using accelerated 
methods, except for Materials and other businesses that
utilize the straight-line method. Depletion of mineral deposits
is calculated over estimated recoverable quantities by the unit-
of-production method.

Intangible Assets Costs in excess of net assets acquired are
amortized ratably over appropriate periods ranging from 20
to 40 years. Other intangibles represent amounts assigned 
principally to the value of programs acquired and are
amortized over periods not exceeding 15 years.

Income Taxes Current income tax provisions represent 
estimated amounts payable or recoverable for each year after
adjustments for permanent differences. Deferred income tax 
provisions represent the tax effect of all significant temporary
differences between financial statements and income taxes.

Research and Development and Similar Costs Research and
development and similar costs are charged to operations as
incurred unless reimbursable under specific contractual 
arrangements. Independent research and development,
systems studies, other concept formulation studies and bid
and proposal work relating to government contracts represent
a major portion of these expenses. Such amounts are
allocated when appropriate to government contracts through 
overhead under government-mandated cost accounting 
procedures.
  Preoperating costs are generally charged to operations
as incurred, except that such costs for significant new
products or services and start-up costs of certain facilities
may be deferred for amortization over periods not to exceed 
five years.

Earnings Per Common Share   Earnings per share are
based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year.
  Earnings per share, assuming no dilution, were computed 
in 1993 based on net earnings less the dividend requirement 
of preferred stock. The weighted average number of common 
shares outstanding assuming no dilution were 95,346,614 in 
1993, 95,868,708 in 1992 and 99,341,210 in 1991.
  Fully diluted earnings per share in 1993 asssumed that
the average number of common shares was increased by the 
conversion of preferred stock from the date of issue and by
dilutive stock options. The weighted average number of
common shares outstanding, assuming full dilution, were
118,347,041 in 1993, 95,868,708 in 1992 and 99,341,210
in 1991.
  On September 30, 1993, a 2-for-1 split of the Corporation's
common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend became
effective. All references in the consolidated financial state-
ments with regard to the number of shares and per share data
have been restated to reflect the split.


Note B:
Business Combination with GE Aerospace

On November 22, 1992, Martin Marietta Corporation 
entered into a Transaction Agreement with General Electric
Company (GE) to combine the aerospace and certain other
businesses of GE (collectively, the "GE Aerospace businesses")
with the businesses of Martin Marietta Corporation in the
form of affiliated corporations. The transaction (the "GE
Transaction"), was consummated on April 2, 1993, and GE 
Aerospace operations have been included since that date.
  The exchange consideration of approximately $3 billion
for the GE Transaction consisted of cash, preferred stock,
retention by GE of certain accounts receivable and the
assumption of payment obligations related to certain GE 
indebtedness. The GE Transaction has been accounted for 
under the purchase method of accounting, wherein
approximately $1.9 billion in goodwill was recognized by the
Corporation after recording approximately $700 million in 
other intangibles (representing the estimated fair-market
value of certain assets) and other purchase adjustments 
necessary to allocate the purchase price to the value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is being amortized 
over a 40-year period, and the other intangibles are being
amortized over a 15-year period.
  The Martin Marietta securities owned by GE are held
under a Standstill Agreement. Among other things, the
Standstill Agreement provides for certain limitations on
either the increase or disposal of GE's interest in voting
securities of Martin Marietta, on GE's solicitation of proxies
and shareowner proposals, on GE's voting of its shares and on
GE's ability to place or remove members of Martin Marietta's
Board of Directors. In addition, the Standstill Agreement
requires Martin Marietta to recommend to its shareowners
the election of persons designated by GE to serve as directors
of Martin Marietta. Generally, the Standstill Agreement
provides that GE's designees will at all times constitute at least
10% of Martin Marietta's Board of Directors.
  In 1986, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan to distribute, under certain circumstances, one
Common Stock Purchase Right for each outstanding share of 
the Corporation's common stock.  The Rights Plan was
amended during 1990. Under the amended plan, the Rights 
became exercisable if a person or group acquires, in a 
transaction not approved by the Board of Directors, 15% or
more of the Corporation's common stock or announces a
tender offer for 30% or more of the stock. The GE 
Transaction was approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation and therefore did not constitute a "Change of
Control" for purposes of the shareholder rights plan. The 
new Martin Marietta Corporation has not adopted a 
shareholder rights plan. 
  The following unaudited pro forma information presents 
the results of operations of the Corporation and the GE 
Aerospace businesses for the years ended December 31, 1993
and 1992, with pro forma adjustments as if the GE 
Transaction had been consummated as of the beginning of 
the periods presented. This pro forma information does not
purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the
acquisition been made as of those dates or of results which
may occur in the future.

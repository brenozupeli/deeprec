(2) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURES

On October 1, 1992, the Company acquired Fisher Controls International, Inc., and its subsidiaries and other related operations
for $1,254.7 million (net of cash and equivalents acquired) in a business combination accounted for as a purchase. Fisher is a 
worldwide manufacturer of control valves and control systems for major process industries including chemical, oil and gas, and
pulp and paper. Assets (excluding cash and equivalents) acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the Company's 
purchase acquisitions follow (dollars in millions):


1994 1993 1992

Fair value of assets acquired ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.  $ 96.7    1,644.1   74.7
Less liabilities assumed ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  38.6      380.7   13.5

  Cash paid, net ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  $ 58.1    1,263.4   61.2


On December 14, 1993, the Company sold the Aerospace unit of its Rosemount Inc. subsidiary (fiscal 1993 sales of 
approximately $130 million) for $301 million ($206 million net of income taxes). The transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $242
million. The net earnings impact of this gain was substantially offset in the first quarter by other non-recurring items ($50 million
pretax impact) and the adoption of SFAS No. 106 (see note 7). Other non-recurring items principally consist of severance and
related costs arising from relocation of several operations, or work force reductions, primarily in the Company's European
heating, ventilating and air conditioning, and process control businesses.

On September 30, 1992, Emerson and Robert Bosch GmbH established a 50-50 joint venture for the development, manufacture 
and distribution of power tools. The Company contributed its Skil business (excluding receivables totaling $65 million and 
certain non-U.S. businesses) and Bosch contributed its U.S. power tool operations and cash of $130 million to form 
S-B Power Tool Company. Emerson received $44 million from the sale of the non-U.S. businesses to the newly formed 
partnership. The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method; Skil had 1992 sales of approximately $350 million. The 
transaction resulted in a 1992 pretax gain of $43 million which is included in Corporate and other items in note 12. The fourth
quarter 1992 results also included a pretax charge of approximately $50 million for the shutdown and restructuring of facilities
and operations, the majority of which is reflected in the Commercial and Industrial segment in note 12. In fiscal 1995, the
Company received a preferential distribution from S-B Power Tool Company of approximately $41 million.

On an unaudited pro forma basis, assuming consummation of the Fisher and Skil/Bosch transactions at the beginning of fiscal
1992, net sales would have been approximately $8,275 million in 1992. Net earnings and earnings per share would not have 
been significantly different from reported amounts.

The results of operations of these businesses have been included in the Company's consolidated results of operations since the
respective dates of the acquisitions and prior to the dates of the divestitures.

(3) SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LINES OF CREDIT

Short-term borrowings consist primarily of commercial paper and non-U.S. bank borrowings as follows (dollars in millions):


United States     Non-U.S.
1994 1993 1992     1994 1993 1992

Borrowings at year end ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ $ 502.2 920.4 176.6 264.2 108.2 175.8

Weighted average interest rate at year end ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  4.6% 4.6% 3.8% 6.2% 7.5% 10.5%

Month-end average borrowings during the year ~~~~~~~~~~~~ $ 741.7 1,335.1 462.3 175.5 133.9 190.7

Month-end weighted average
  interest rate during the year ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 4.6% 4.4% 4.3% 6.8% 10.0% 10.1%

Highest month-end level of 
  borrowings during the year ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ $ 1,014.4 1,546.3 581.2 264.2 168.8 230.5


In October 1992, in connection with the Fisher acquisition (see note 2), the Company issued $1.275 billion of U.S. commercial
paper and swapped these borrowings to a weighted average fixed rate of 4.6 percent. At September 30, 1994, approximately
$650 million of the Company's floating interest rate borrowings remained swapped for up to one year; at September 30, 1993,
borrowings of approximately $900 million were swapped for periods up to two years. Excluding the impact of these swaps, 
interest expense would have been $83 million and $105 million, and the U.S. year-end weighted average interest rate would 
have been 4.9 percent and 3.1 percent in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

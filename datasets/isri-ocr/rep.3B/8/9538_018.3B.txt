the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion
of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable move-
ments in either foreign exchange or interest rates.  As such, the
Company's operating results and financial position may be
adversely affected.

Inventory

The Company's products include certain components, such as
specific microprocessors manufactured by Motorola, Inc., that
are currently available only from single sources.  Any availability
limitations, interruptions in supplies, or price increases of these
and other components could adversely affect the Company's
business and financial results.  The Company's future operating
results and financial condition may also be adversely affected by
the Company's ability to manage inventory levels and lead times
required to obtain components in order to be more responsive
to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  In addition,
if anticipated unit sales growth for new and current product
offerings is not realized, inventory valuation reserves may be
necessary that would adversely affect the Company's results of
operations and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties exist regarding the marketing and
distribution of the Company's products.  Currently, the Com-
pany's primary means of distribution is through third-party
computer resellers.  However, in response to changing industry
practices and customer preferences, the Company is continuing
its expansion into various consumer channels, such as mass-


merchandise stores (for example, Sears and Wal-Mart), consumer
electronics outlets, and computer superstores.  The Company's
business and financial results could be adversely affected if the
financial condition of these sellers weakens or if sellers within
consumer channels decide not to continue to distribute the
Company's products.

Other Factors

The majority of the Company's research and development
activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business
operations are located near major seismic faults.  The Company's
operating results and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.
  The Company plans to replace its current transaction systems
(which include order management, distribution, manufacturing,
and finance) with a single integrated system as part of its ongoing
effort to increase operational efficiency.  The Company's future
operating results and financial condition could be adversely
affected by its ability to implement and effectively manage the
transition to this new integrated system.

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting
the Company's operating results and financial condition, past
financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable
indicator of future performance, and investors should not use
historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
In addition, the Company's participation in a highly dynamic
industry often results in significant volatility of the Company's
common stock price.


Liquidity and Capital Resources  1994 1993 1992

Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings   $ 966 $ 69 $ 1,251
Working capital $ 2,532 $ 1,830 $ 2,151
Cash generated by (used for) operations $ 737 $ (651) $ 921
Cash used for investment activities, excluding short-term investments  $ 163 $ 228 $ 264
Cash generated by (used for) financing activities $ (208) $ 336 $ (114)


The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, net of short-term
borrowings, increased to $966 million at September 30, 1994,
from $69 million at September 24, 1993.  This increase reflects a
$300 million issuance of ten-year unsecured notes, the proceeds
of which replaced a portion of the Company's short-term financ-
ing.  The improvement in the Company's financial condition was
also attributable to the Company's continued efforts to increase
profit levels and to manage working capital, particularly in the
area of inventory management.
  More cash was generated by operations in 1994 compared
with 1993, primarily because of a significant decrease in inventory


levels, as well as increased sales levels.  The significant decrease in
inventory levels during 1994 resulted from improved inventory
management, higher 1994 sales levels attributable to various
pricing and promotional actions, and strong sales of new product
inventory that had been built up in preparation for the intro-
duction of Power Macintosh.  Profit levels improved as operating
expenses decreased due to the Company's implementation of
restructuring actions initiated in the third quarter of 1993.
  Cash generated by operations in 1994 was partially offset
by cash used for restructuring and an increase in accounts
receivable.  The increase in accounts receivable reflected an
increase in sales levels achieved during 1994.  The balance of

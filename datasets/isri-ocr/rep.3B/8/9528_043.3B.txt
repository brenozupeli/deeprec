Credit Agreement"), partially offset by a $225 million credit for a change in estimated postretirement
health care liabilities.

NOTE 2 ~ EARNINGS PER SHARE

  Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and Series A
Depositary Shares (hereinafter defined) outstanding during the period and common stock assumed to be outstand-
ing to reflect the effect of dilutive warrants and options.  Holdings' other potentially dilutive securities are not
included in the earnings per share calculation because the effect of excluding interest and dividends on such secu-
rities for the period would exceed the earnings allocable to the common stock into which such securities would be
converted.  Accordingly, Holdings' earnings per share and fully diluted earnings per share are the same.

C. Credit Arrangements:

 IBP has a $250,000,000 senior revolving/term facility (the
Revolving/Term Facility) and a $125,000,000 short-term
revolving facility (the Short-Term Revolver). Both committed
facilities bear interest, at the Company's option, at varying rates
based upon the banks' base rates or an uncommitted bid
option. From time to time, IBP also uses uncommitted lines of
credit for some or all of its short-term borrowing needs.

 The Revolving/Term Facility is a revolving facility which may
be extended for one-year increments annually during the
revolving period with consent of the banks involved. The
revolving period has been extended through November 15, 
1994. At the end of the revolving period, any outstanding
borrowings are converted to a two-year credit facility with equal
quarterly payments. Commitment fees are .275 to .375 of 1%
on the bid option and the unused portion of the committed 
facility.

 The Short-Term Revolver may be extended semi-annually for
additional six-month periods with consent of the banks involved.
It has been extended through November 10, 1994. Commit-
ment fees are .125 to .25 of 1% on the unused portion of the
facility.

 Borrowings under the Revolving/Term Facility are treated as
current liabilities with the exception of $100,000,000 which IBP


does not intend to repay within one year. This amount is
classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheet for
1993; the interest rate at December 25, 1993 on such borrow-
ings was 3.6%.

 During 1993, the maximum amount of short-term borrow-
ings under all of IBP's credit arrangements was $137,000,000.
Average short-term borrowings and the weighted average
interest rate during 1993 were $55,687,000 and 3.4%. At
December 25, 1993, total borrowings outstanding under 
committed facilities, including the $100,000,000 classified as
long-term, were $100,000,000 and the unused portion totaled
$275,000,000.

D. Accounts Payable and

                                $340,279       $357,419


E. Income Taxes:

 Effective December 27, 1992, IBP adopted SFAS No. 109 on
a prospective basis. The cumulative effect of adopting this
statement was to increase net earnings by $12.6 million in fiscal
1993. SFAS No. 109 requires that prior accounting for business
combinations, such as IBP's application of "pushdown account-
ing" to its acquisition by Occidental in 1981, be adjusted to
reflect remaining assets at fair value rather than net-of-tax value
as under APB No. 11. Any difference between the adjusted 
remaining balance and the tax bases are accounted for as 
temporary differences. The cumulative effect of the accounting
change was an increase in property, plant and equipment of
$23.4 million, net of accumulated depreciation of $80.2

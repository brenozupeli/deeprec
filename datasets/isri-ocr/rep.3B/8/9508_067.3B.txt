effective rates is as follows:

Other-~net			 2.1		 1.2		 .8

				31.3%		31.4%		32.1%


	The tax effects of temporary differences and carryfor-
wards that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax
assets and liabilities consist of the following (in millions):


December 31,				1993		1992
Deferred tax assets:
	Benefit plans			$ 298		$ 297
	Liabilities and reserves	  177		  119
	Net operating loss carryforwards  141		  101
	Other				  120		   84

1Deferred tax assets of $139 million have been included in the consoli-
dated balance sheet caption marketable securities and other assets at
December 31, 1993.


	At December 31, 1993, the Company had $403 million
of operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future
taxable income of certain international subsidiaries.  Loss
carryforwards of $293 million must be utilized within the
next five years, and $110 million can be utilized over an
indefinite period.  A valuation allowance has been provided
for a portion of the deferred tax assets related to these loss
carryforwards.


	As the result of changes in U.S. tax law, the Company
was required to record charges for additional taxes and
tax-related expenses that reduced net income by approxi-
mately $51 million in 1993.  The Company's effective tax
rate reflects the favorable U.S. tax treatment from manu-
facturing facilities in Puerto Rico that operate under a
negotiated exemption grant that expires December 31,
2009, as well as the tax benefit derived from significant
operations outside the United States, which are taxed at
rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent.
Changes to U.S. tax law enacted in 1993 will limit the
utilization of the favorable tax treatment from operations
in Puerto Rico beginning in 1994, and will exert upward
pressure on the Company's effective tax rate.
	Appropriate U.S. and international taxes have been
provided for earnings of subsidiary companies that are
expected to be remitted to the parent company.  The cumu-
lative amount of unremitted earnings of international
subsidiaries that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested,
exclusive of amounts that, if remitted, would result in little
or no tax, is approximately $426 million at December 31,
1993.  The taxes that would be paid upon remittance of
these earnings are approximately $149 million.

16.  Net Change in Operating Assets and Liabilities

of acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and unreal-
ized exchange gains/losses, are as follows (in millions):

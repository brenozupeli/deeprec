Letter to


Shareholders


"The best way for the company to earn credibility from investors is to deliver results that track with
our objectives.  We expect to do just that and, as a result, emerge among the top tier of
packaged-goods companies in terms of trendline earnings-per-share growth."


  The company's businesses apart from
domestic tobacco posted strong sales and
earnings growth.  Our international tobacco
and worldwide continuing food businesses,
combined, posted net sales up 9 percent
and operating income up 14 percent.
  Our worldwide food businesses had
robust performance in 1993.  Amid a slug-
gish environment for food businesses, we
managed to have another record year for
new products.  We expanded our success-
ful SnackWell's line of reduced-fat and non-
fat cookies and crackers, completed a
national roll-out of Gummi Savers candy,
introduced new nut products that moved
Planters into the broader snack arena,
developed a convenient, refrigerated ver-
sion of our category-leading Egg Beaters,
and strengthened our cookie leadership
with new Chunky Chips Ahoy! and fruit
Newtons varieties.  Our international food
business grew sales by 25 percent, with
strong growth in Latin America and entry
into Spain and Portugal.  Those are only the
highlights.  There are many, many others.
  Worldwide, our tobacco volume was
up 9 percent from a year ago as a result of
continued growth in international markets.
Although sales and earnings declined over-
all as a result of U.S. pricing, we saw real
indications by year's end of returning
stability in the domestic market that should
enable us to improve profits significantly
from last year's performance.  Over the
past five years, our international tobacco
business has grown volume faster than
any other company in the industry.  We will
build on that record with additional invest-
ments and expansion in recently entered
markets in Eastern Europe as well as in
other markets.  And domestic tobacco still
delivered more cash flow than virtually any
other type of consumer product in the
marketplace, with operating profit margins
still among the most attractive in the pack-
aged-goods business.


  We unified our domestic and interna-
tional tobacco and food businesses into two
worldwide organizations last year.  We
believe the new organizations will be better
able to compete effectively on a global
basis, bringing greater marketing clout and
technology to new markets and realizing
greater efficiency and shareholder returns.

Significant Investable Funds

  Our food and tobacco businesses form
the base for our growth plans, which
depend on running our existing businesses
as competitively and profitably as possible
and investing in new businesses that meet
our return objective.  That investment
requires cash, which, fortunately, we can
generate in large quantities over time.
  For example, in 1993, despite the pres-
sures in the domestic tobacco business,
RJR Nabisco delivered $1.03 billion of free
cash flow, which was well in excess of
most of our consumer-products peer
companies.  In addition, we spent
$615 million on capital investments last
year.  So, in total, we generated $1.65 billion
of investable funds last year.  We used
some of those funds to pay down debt,
which we'll continue to do until we reach
our capitalization target.  The rest of the
funds we invested in new projects to grow
future earnings.  Those projects -~ expan-
sions of manufacturing capacity for high-
demand products and acquisitions of inter-
ests in new companies such as Royal Brands
of Spain -~ promise returns on investment
that will enhance shareholder value.

Managing Short-Term Issues

  We confronted a number of headline-
grabbing issues last year -~ tobacco prices
and potential excise taxes among them -~
that will continue to be important to the
company.  But, nonetheless, in the broader
context of building shareholder wealth,
they are short-term issues.  Successful

shareholders


delivered to Perry would be diverted to the
Company's other Iowa plants. Among the
Company's alternatives is to take the
equipment in the Perry plant and use it in
the renovation of the recently purchased
pork plant at Logansport.
  Although the plant's closure would affect
the Company's capacity long-term, there
should be no near-term impact on total
Pork Division production levels. The
potential adverse impact on 1994 operating
earnings is not expected to be significant.
Whatever the outcome, stockholders can be
assured the financial performance of the
plant will either be significantly improved or
the plant closed.

International Sales

  The dramatic export growth that IBP has
experienced since the early 1980s contin-
ued in 1993.  Export sales increased by
8.2% over last year and represented 11.9%
of the Company's net sales.
  Despite weakness in the Japanese
economy, the Far East remained a major
contributor to IBP's success in the interna-
tional marketplace.  Export sales to that part
of the world were up 12% over 1992.
  Thanks to improved packaging technol-


ogy, we have been able to ship more
chilled instead of frozen beef and pork to
Japan.  Japan now accounts for more than
half of all U.S. beef, veal and variety meat
exports.  It is also the largest export market
for U.S. pork, accounting for two-thirds of
total export sales.
  Mexico continues to be a growing
market for U.S. meat products and
promises to get even better, thanks in part


to the North
American Free
Trade Agreement
(NAFTA). We
believe that as the
Mexican economy
improves, so will
its demand for
high quality U.S.


beef and pork.  In fact, some analysts
expect Mexico to someday become the U.S.
red meat industry's largest export cus-
tomer.

Quality Control/Food Safety

  The safety of America's food supply is
of growing importance to the consumer.
That is why IBP continues to implement
quality management programs designed to


Making sure IBP's
products are
wholesome and
meet customer
specifications is
the objective of
IBP's quality
management
programs.

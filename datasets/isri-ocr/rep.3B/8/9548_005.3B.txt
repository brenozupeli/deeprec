  We recognize that we must make an equal commitment in the rest of the developing world. In Latin
America, reduction of tariffs, stabilization of governments and increased privatization create opportunities.
Emerson is establishing corporate offices in Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela to better serve our customers in
that region.
  In other key developing areas of the world -~ Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and the Middle
East -~ we plan to take advantage of our European products and organizations as a base for leveraging
resources into these adjacent areas. In fiscal 1994, we developed five production facilities in Eastern Europe
which will provide a basis for expansion. In each of these areas, we expect to double our business in the 
next five years.

4. Expansion Through Acquisitions and Joint Ventures

  The final cornerstone in our growth strategy relates to Emerson's ability to use acquisitions and joint
ventures to strengthen our industry positions and improve our growth prospects. Since last year's report, we
are investing over $600 million in new acquisitions. Two principal investments relate to our motors and
drives business. F.G. Wilson, a United Kingdom-based producer of power generation systems, has established
distribution in all major markets and a strong market presence in the developing world. Its best-cost
position, combined with Emerson's alternator, automatic transfer switch and uninterruptible power supply
products, creates a major growth opportunity in the rapidly expanding stand-by power market.
  Additionally, we are in the process of completing the acquisition of Control Techniques, a United Kingdom-
based producer of electronic drives for motor applications in which Emerson took a 29 percent position in 1991
by investing the assets of our Industrial Controls Division and cash. Control Techniques provides leading-edge 
variable speed drive technology in a high-growth area of the motors and drives business. Its global drive center
network also complements Emerson's sales infrastructure and will support the introduction of switched 
reluctance technology into general-purpose applications.
  In addition to acquisitions, our use of joint ventures is another important approach to expansion. The 
success of Emerson's S-B Power Tool, Astec and Control Techniques joint ventures demonstrates the value of 
this approach to broaden geographic and product markets. Since their formation, these businesses have 
significantly improved their positions. In combination with Vermont American, these companies comprise 80
percent of Emerson's joint venture sales volume. In fiscal 1994 alone, they increased their earnings contribution
to the Company by 33 percent. Emerson participates in 19 other joint ventures, which also grew sales and
earnings in fiscal 1994. Our challenge is to continue to identify partnerships to increase growth by working
with others to gain access to unique markets and product technologies.

  In summary, we believe we know what steps are required to drive top-line growth at levels above economy-
driven expectations for each of our businesses, while maintaining our commitment to consistent financial
performance. We are investing in technologies and infrastructure necessary to support a higher level of growth
programming as we did in implementing the Best Cost Producer strategy. This is a long-term effort, and we are
committed to creating the environment necessary to make it happen.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


12.  Restricted Stock, Stock Options
and Other Stock Plans
The Company sponsors restricted stock award plans, stock
option plans, Incentive Unit Agreements and Performance
Unit Agreements.

	Under the amended 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan
and the amended 1983 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the
Restricted Stock Plans), 20 million and 12 million shares
of restricted common stock, respectively, may be granted
to certain officers and key employees of the Company.

	At December 31, 1993, 17 million shares were available
for grant under the Restricted Stock Plans.  The participant
is entitled to vote and receive dividends on the shares, and,
under the 1983 Restricted Stock Award Plan, the partici-
pant is reimbursed by the Company for income taxes
imposed on the award, but not for taxes generated by the
reimbursement payment.  The shares are subject to certain
transfer restrictions and may be forfeited if the participant
leaves the Company for reasons other than retirement, dis-
ability or death, absent a change in control of the Company.
On July 18, 1991, the Restricted Stock Plans were amended
to specify age 62 as the minimum retirement age.  The 1983
Restricted Stock Award Plan was further amended to con-
form to the terms of the 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan
by requiring a minimum of five years of service between the
date of the award and retirement.  The amendments affect
shares granted after July 18, 1991.

	Under the Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan (the
Option Plan), a maximum of 60 million shares of the
Company's common stock may be issued or transferred to
certain officers and employees pursuant to stock options
and stock appreciation rights granted under the Option
Plan.  The stock appreciation rights permit the holder, upon
surrendering all or part of the related stock option, to
receive cash, common stock or a combination thereof, in an
amount up to 100 percent of the difference between the
market price and the option price.  No stock appreciation
rights have been granted since 1990, and the Company
presently does not intend to grant additional stock appreci-
ation rights in the future.  Options outstanding at December
31, 1993, also include various options granted under
previous plans.  Further information relating to options is as

	In 1988, the Company entered into Incentive Unit Agree-
ments, whereby, subject to certain conditions, certain officers
were given the right to receive cash awards based on the market
value of 1.2 million shares of the Company's common stock at
the measurement dates.  Under the Incentive Unit Agreements,
the employee is reimbursed by the Company for income taxes
imposed when the value of the units is paid, but not for taxes
generated by the reimbursement payment.  As of December 31,
1993, 400,000 units have been paid and 800,000 units were
outstanding.

	In 1985, the Company entered into Performance Unit
Agreements, whereby certain officers were given the right to
receive cash awards based on the difference in the market
value of approximately 2.2 million shares of the Company's
common stock at the measurement dates and the base price
of $5.16, the market value as of January 2, 1985.  As of 
December 31, 1993, 780,000 units have been paid and
approximately 1.4 million units were outstanding.

13.  Pension Benefits
The Company sponsors and/or contributes to pension plans
covering substantially all U.S. employees and certain em-
ployees in international locations.  The benefits are primarily
based on years of service and the employees' compensation
for certain periods during the last years of employment.
Pension costs are generally funded currently, subject to
regulatory funding limitations.  The Company also sponsors
nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit plans for certain
officers and other employees.  In addition, the Company and
its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms
of postretirement arrangements outside the United States.

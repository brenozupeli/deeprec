Report of Management


The consolidated financial statements of Textron Inc.
have been prepared by management and have been 
audited by Textron's independent auditors, Ernst &
Young, whose report appears below. Management is
responsible for the consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles and include amounts 
based on management's judgments.
  Management is also responsible for maintaining 
internal accounting control systems designed to provide
reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that assets are
safeguarded and that transactions are executed and 
recorded in accordance with established policies and
procedures. Textron's systems are under continuing 
review and are supported by, among other things, busi-
ness conduct and other written guidelines, an internal
audit function and the selection and training of qualified 
personnel.


  The Board of Directors, through its Audit Commit-
tee, oversees management's financial reporting responsi-
bilities. The Audit Committee, comprised of five out-
side directors, meets regularly with the independent
auditors, representatives of management and the inter-
nal auditors to discuss and make inquiries into their
activities. Both the independent auditors and the inter-
nal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee, 
with and without management representatives in 
attendance.

Report of Independent Auditors


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Textron Inc.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated bal-
ance sheet of Textron Inc. as of January 1, 1994 and
January 2, 1993, and the related consolidated state-
ments of income, cash flows and changes in shareholders'
equity for each of the three years in the period ended 
January 1, 1994. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accordance with gener-
ally accepted auditing standards. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial state-
ments are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting princi-
ples used and significant estimates made by manage-
ment, as well as evaluating the overall financial state-
ment presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.


  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to 
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consoli-
dated financial position of Textron Inc. at January 1,
1994 and January 2, 1993 and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended January 1, 1994 in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles.
  As discussed in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated
financial statements, in fiscal 1992 the Company 
changed its methods of accounting for postretirement
benefits other than pensions and income taxes.

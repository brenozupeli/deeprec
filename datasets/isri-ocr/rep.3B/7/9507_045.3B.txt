	Chrysler's management is responsible for preparing the financial
statements and other financial information in this Annual Report.  This


responsibility includes maintaining the integrity and objectivity of financial data and the presentation of
Chrysler's results of operations and financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  The financial statements include amounts that are based on management's best estimates
and judgments.
	Chrysler's financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche, independent auditors.
Their audits were conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and included
consideration of the internal control system and tests of transactions as part of planning and per-
forming their audits.
	Chrysler maintains a system of internal controls that provides reasonable assurance that its
records reflect its transactions in all material respects and that significant misuse or loss of assets will
be prevented.  Management believes the system of internal controls is adequate to accomplish these
objectives on a continuous basis.  Chrysler maintains a strong internal auditing program that indepen-
dently assesses the effectiveness of the internal controls and recommends possible improvements.
Management considers the General Auditor's and Deloitte & Touche's recommendations concerning
the system of internal controls and takes appropriate actions to respond to these recommendations.
	The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee composed solely of nonemployee
directors, is responsible for determining that management fulfills its responsibilities in the preparation
of financial statements and the maintenance of internal controls.  In fulfilling its responsibility, the Audit
Committee recommends independent auditors to the Board of Directors for appointment by the
shareholders.  The Committee also reviews the consolidated financial statements and adequacy of
internal controls.  The Audit Committee meets regularly with management, the General Auditor and
the independent auditors.  Both the independent auditors and the General Auditor have full and free
access to the Audit Committee, without management representatives present, to discuss the scope
and results of their audits and their views on the adequacy of internal controls and the quality of
financial reporting.
	It is the business philosophy of Chrysler Corporation and its subsidiaries to obey the law and to
require that its employees conduct their activities according to the highest standards of business
ethics.  Management reinforces this philosophy by numerous actions, including issuing a Code of
Ethical Behavior and maintaining a Business Practices Committee and a Business Practices Office to
support compliance with the Corporation's policies.

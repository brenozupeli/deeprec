The complications of diabetes can seriously diminish
  the quality of life for more than 120 million diabetics
  worldwide.  More than 50% of diabetics eventually will
  suffer from neuropathy, a degeneration of the nervous
  system, and retinopathy, a major cause of blindness.
  Nephropathy, a kidney ailment, also afflicts more than
  half of all diabetics and is one of the leading causes
  of death in juvenile diabetics.


Alredase


Wyeth-Ayerst's Alredase (tolrestat) is the first of a class
  of drugs known as aldose reductase inhibitors to be
  commercially available for the management of
  diabetic complications.  It has been approved as a
  therapy for diabetic neuropathy in 19 countries
  and is marketed in nine of them.  Alredase is in
  advanced Phase III studies in the United States for
  the treatment of the diabetic complications of
  neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy.  Filing
  of a New Drug Application for the neuropathy
  indication is planned in 1994 upon successful
  completion of multi-center studies in the United
  States and Canada.  Data from these studies,
  the most expansive of their kind, are expected to
  have a significant impact on the management of
  diabetic neuropathy.


Each year in the
United States,
nearly 50,000
people with
diabetes have
lower limbs
amputated
because of the
complications
of neuropathy.

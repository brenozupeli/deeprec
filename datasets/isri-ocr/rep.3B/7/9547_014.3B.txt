Systems

For Complex Commercial and Technical Applications


"Alpha AXP chips lead the industry in performance, 
setting a standard in the open market and building
momentum for Digital as a merchant vendor of micro-
processors and PCI peripheral chips."

-~ Ed Caldwell, Vice President, Digital Semiconductor
   Digital Equipment Corporation

"It is not a question of when you will need 64 bits.
It is a question of when you will need that thirty-third
bit. For a lot of applications, that time is now."

-~ Willy Shih, Vice President
   Product Strategy
   Computer Systems Division
   Digital Equipment Corporation


"You don't just buy technology, you make an investment.
And when you invest you have to look at the long term.
You can't afford to buy equipment that will become 
obsolete in a matter of years."

-~ Richard C. Zbikowski, Project Manager

Boston Edison: Alpha AXP
systems provide the power
for realtime energy man-
agement and control
Few realtime applications
are as demanding as energy
management and control.
Electric utilities like Boston
Edison have to balance 
the supply and demand for
power. This requires highly
reliable realtime processing
and specialized application
software.

In updating its energy
management and control
system, Boston Edison was
looking for a distributed,
workstation-based solution
that wouldn't become obso-
lete in a matter of years. They
wanted an open architecture.

They were one of the first,
but by no means the last,
major electric utility to move
their energy management 
and control to Alpha AXP
workstations and computers.
In fact, of the 23 large 
(million-dollar-plus) energy
management and control
contracts signed by North
American utilities in 1993,
13 of the wins went to Alpha
AXP systems, according to 
a study by Newton-Evans
Research of Ellicott City,


Maryland. In the U.K.,
Southern Electric, Northern
Electric, Yorkshire Elec-
tricity, SEEBOARD, London
Electricity and the National
Grid Company have all cho-
sen Alpha AXP systems for 
major projects.

Boston Edison chose Alpha
AXP systems running UNIX
and EMS/SCADA software
over IBM RS6000 AIX sys-
tems. In addition to provid-
ing Edison with a price/
performance advantage,
Digital offered a 64-bit
UNIX solution that supports
clusters and multiprocessing
while meeting X/Open and 
other industry standards.
Equally important was the 
availability of EMS/SCADA
realtime software from CAE
Electronics, Ltd., a Digital
Technical OEM partner. CAE,
based in Montreal, Canada,
is a worldwide leader in the 
development of power distri-
bution systems and recently 
won two contracts to install
Alpha AXP systems in China.

Boston Edison's Alpha AXP
systems form part of a power
distribution network that
serves more than 650,000
commercial, residential 
and industrial customers.

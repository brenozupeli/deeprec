Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation:  The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of American Home
Products Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company).

Cash and Cash Equivalents, for purposes of reporting cash flows,
consists primarily of certificates of deposit, time deposits and
other short-term, highly liquid securities and is stated at cost,
which approximates fair value.

Marketable Securities consists of U.S. government or agency
issues and corporate bonds and are stated at cost, which
approximates fair value.  The fair values are estimated based on
quoted market prices.  In May 1993, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 115 -~ Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities.  This Statement will be adopted
in the first quarter of 1994, and the effect will be immaterial to
the Company.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Inventories
valued under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method amounted to
$148,700,000 at December 31, 1993 and $265,816,000 at
December 31, 1992.  Current value exceeded LIFO value by
$65,607,000 and $52,894,000 at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively.  The remaining inventories are valued under
the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or the average cost method.

Client/server computing
brings these two very dif-
ferent styles of computing
together.

Digital's contribution was
to develop the network
platforms, software frame-
works, integration and
support services, strategic
alliances, and business
practices needed to fully
implement the client/
server concept. Working 
with our strategic partners,
we are creating an open,
enterprise-wide computing 
environment to meet the
needs of customers seeking
to develop a competitive 
advantage or maximize the
use of existing personnel
and computing resources.

As a company, we are 
focusing on our core 
competencies -~ the four
prerequisites for leader-
ship in open, multivendor
client/server computing:

~
Software -~ The software
frameworks customers need 
to develop client/server
applications and integrate
PC, Macintosh, UNIX,
OpenVMS, Windows NT,
OSF/1, Sun, Hewlett-
Packard, IBM and other
systems.


~
Systems -~ Powerful 64-
and 32-bit client and server
systems based on Alpha
AXP, VAX and Intel micro-
processors with the capacity 
to handle the huge amounts 
of information inherent 
in enterprise-wide client/
server applications.

~
Networks -~ The hardware
and software needed to open
up the Information Super-
highway and link clients and
servers -~ switches, routers,
hubs, network adapters,
network operating systems,
and mobile/wireless and
other telecommunications
solutions.

~
Services -~ The systems 
and network integration
and multivendor customer
services needed to plan,
design, integrate, imple-
ment, manage and main-
tain open multivendor
client/server networks that
include both legacy systems
and new technology.

These four competencies
are interrelated. And -~
combined with the organi-
zational skills needed to 
develop and implement 
client/server environments
-~ they provide the foun-
dation upon which Digital,
its customers and its 
strategic partners can 
base their future.


"Digital's Components Division delivers world-class prod-
ucts to build open, networked client/server environments
that simplify business processes and increase productiv-
ity. We provide networking hardware, StorageWorks sub-
systems, printers, terminals and other components to 
Digital and other computer manufacturers, as well as to
distributors and resellers."

-~ Charles Christ, Vice President and General Manager
   Components Division

"If you profess support for open client/server comput-
ing, you have to support multiple operating systems. 
Digital is fully committed to UNIX, OpenVMS and
Windows NT because they all have a place in client/
server environments."

-~ William D. Strecker
   Chief Technical Officer and Vice President
   Advanced Technology Group
   Digital Equipment Corporation

With open client/server
computing, we are helping 
customers reengineer their
operations, open new mar-
kets, develop new products
and improve both personal
and corporate productivity.

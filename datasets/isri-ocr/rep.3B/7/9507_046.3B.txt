We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Corporation and consolidated
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of earnings and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
	We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial state-
ments are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting prin-
ciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial state-
ment presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
	In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Chrysler Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in confor-
mity with generally accepted accounting principles.
	As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, the Company has adopted recently issued
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards and, accordingly, changed its methods of accounting for postre-
tirement benefits other than pensions and postemployment benefits in 1993, and its method of accounting
for income taxes in 1992.  In addition, the Company changed its method of accounting for the cost of special
sales incentive programs in 1991.

Notional amount                   $3,543   $3,773
Fair value: gains                     13       77
            losses                   252      199

  The estimated unrealized losses shown above represent the incremental charge to earnings to
immediately settle all interest rate swaps.  However, it is the Company's current intention to
leave these instruments outstanding until maturity over various periods extending to the year
2004, in which case no incremental charge to earnings will be realized.

Currency Instruments
The Company is subject to market rate risk from exposure to changes in currency exchange rates
primarily in three areas:  commercial transactions, intercompany financings and net investments
in foreign subsidiaries.
  The primary purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging activities is to protect
against the risk that local currency cash flows associated with purchase transactions will be
adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.  Although this foreign currency exposure is
managed locally, corporate policy prescribes the range of hedging activity into which the
subsidiary operations may enter.  To execute this policy, the Company utilizes forward exchange
contracts and options with durations of generally less than twelve months.  The impact of
changes in the value of these instruments typically offsets changes in the value of the underlying
transactions.  For accounting purposes, gains and losses on option contracts that hedge
identifiable anticipated transactions and on forward contracts that hedge firm commitments are
included in the measurement of the related transaction.  Gains and losses on instruments used
for other purposes are recognized currently.
  The Company manages its foreign exchange exposure associated with intercompany
financing transactions primarily using foreign currency swaps.  Gains and losses on such
instruments mitigate the impact on earnings of currency exchange rate changes on the
underlying transactions.
  The impact of net asset exposures related to investments in foreign subsidiaries are managed
primarily through local currency financing, and by foreign currency denominated debt issued
by the parent company.  As discussed in the interest rate instruments section, the Company has
also entered into currency interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the principal and
interest cash flows of certain existing debt to foreign currency obligations.  The currency
translation associated with these obligations is designated as a hedge of the net investment in
the foreign subsidiaries and reflected in the currency translation adjustment in shareholders'
equity.

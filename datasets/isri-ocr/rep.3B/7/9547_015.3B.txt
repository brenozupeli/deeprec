First Data: How UNIX and 
Alpha AXP technology gave
a Digital business partner
a competitive edge in the
healthcare field
First Data Corp.'s Health
Systems Group serves some 
700 hospitals and healthcare
facilities in the U.S. and inter-
national markets. The com-
pany designs and markets
leading-edge healthcare
technology solutions, includ-
ing computer-based patient
record applications. Three 
of their newest customer 
reference accounts are using
UNIX-based Alpha AXP
systems.

At Georgetown Memorial,
Roper and Union Memorial
hospitals, these systems are
dramatically reducing the
time it takes to run major
reports and financial recon-
ciliations. At Georgetown
Memorial, reports that took 
four to six hours are now 
completed in 20 minutes.
At Roper Hospital, monthly
financial reporting that took
24 hours is now finished in 
one to two hours.


On the strength of this
performance, First Data 
is closing additional Alpha
AXP system sales. With 
Alpha AXP systems and 
services, Digital provides
First Data with a robust,
industrial-strength UNIX
together with the tools 
needed to develop and main-
tain complex client/server
and database applications.

And it is the ability to 
develop new applications
that provides Digital busi-
ness partners like First Data 
with the competitive advan-
tage they need to succeed 
in a changing marketplace.


"Digital has given us what we needed: UNIX that meets 
industry standards. Alpha AXP systems that set the stan-
dard for performance. And the kind of support that comes
with a true business partnership."

-~ Larry Ferguson, President
   First Data Corp.

How big is 64 bits?

If one bit of information is represented by the smallest printable dot - one pixel -~ a square representing
16 bits of information would consist of 65,536 pixels, and would cover an area of about three-~quarters
of an inch. A square representing 32 bits would cover an area eighteen by eighteen feet. To represent
64 bits -~ 4 billion times larger than 32 bits -~ an area the size of Greece, 51,000 square miles, would
be required.

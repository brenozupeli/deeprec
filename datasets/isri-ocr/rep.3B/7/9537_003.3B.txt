~ In October 1993, the Board
of Directors approved manage-
ment's recommendation to
increase the quarterly dividend
to $.73 per share.  With this 
increase, the 1993 dividend
was $2.86, an 8% increase
over the 1992 dividend of
$2.66.

Research and Development
Underscoring the priority we
attach to product innovation
as the key to our Company's
future growth, our R&D
expenditures, including those
of Genetics Institute, increased
to $663 million in 1993.  This
represents a 20% increase over


the prior year.
  We are focused on areas of
critical need where we have significant knowledge based on
established products and intensive R&D programs.  We also are
"fast tracking" product candidates that have the greatest poten-
tial.  A special report highlighting several of our R&D programs
follows this letter.

Ethical Pharmaceuticals

A number of positive steps, including important new drug
introductions, were taken to strengthen our broad-based
pharmaceutical business.  We established the Wyeth-Ayerst
Women's Health Research Institute in 1993 to build upon our
global leadership position in women's health care.  Premarin, the
most widely prescribed drug in the United States, continued to
expand in worldwide markets.  A major addition to our U.S.
pharmaceutical product line is the structurally novel antidepres-
sant, Effexor, which will be available in the spring of 1994.
The approval and introduction of Oruvail and Lodine 400 mg.
strengthen Wyeth-Ayerst's position in the important anti-
inflammatory market.  1993 also saw the marketing launch of
Genetics Institute's Recombinate, the first genetically engineered
form of recombinant antihemophilic factor (rAHF), a blood-
clotting protein used to treat hemophilia.


  We continued to enter
into collaborative scientific
ventures that are using
biotechnology and other
important emerging
technologies to develop
new therapies in many
areas.  Wyeth-Ayerst, in
1993, signed a collaborative
agreement with Cygnus
Therapeutic Systems, Inc.
to develop and market
transdermal hormone
replacement products on a
global basis.

Consumer Health Care

The performance of
major brands such as Advil,
Robitussin and Dimetapp
strengthened Whitehall-


Robins as a leader in the increasingly competitive non-
prescription analgesic and cough/cold/allergy categories in the
United States.
  Our excellent, growing core franchises in the United States
place us in a strong position to capture a larger share of the
self-medication market worldwide.  This market is expected to
expand significantly as governments seek to control health
care costs and as consumer interest in self-diagnosis and self-
treatment increases.  We are moving vigorously to capitalize on
these trends by extending our core franchises internationally
and by building a pipeline of prescription products that are can-
didates for "switching" to the OTC market.

Animal Health Care

Strong growth for Fort Dodge Laboratories in the United States
augmented our leadership in key areas of veterinary pharma-
ceuticals and biologicals.  LymeVax, our Lyme disease vaccine,
became the single largest-dollar-volume canine vaccine in
the United States.  Fort Dodge also began to introduce a wide
range of products in Europe.

Litton Industries, Inc.       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


The Company has issued or is a party to various guarantees and letter of credit agreements totalling $190 
million at July 31, 1994. These arrangements relate principally to the guarantee of future performance,
mainly on foreign government contracts.

Note J: Extraordinary Item and Unusual Item

On July 11, 1994, the Company effected an in-substance defeasance of its 12~~~% Subordinated Debentures
by placing direct U.S. Government obligations in an irrevocable trust to provide for the redemption,
according to their terms, on July 1, 1995 at 104.2% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest (see
Note C). Due to this in-substance defeasance, results for fiscal year 1994 included an extraordinary loss on
early extinguishment of debt of $49.2 million pre-tax, or $30.7 million after tax. The effect on primary
earnings per share for the year was a decrease of $.67.

On July 14, 1994, the Company settled a civil suit brought under the so-called qui tam provisions of the
False Claims Act (see Note I) and recorded a charge of $86.0 million to the operating results of the
Advanced Electronics segment. On an after-tax basis, the impact of this settlement was a $53.8 million
loss, or a decrease of $1.18 to primary earnings per share for the year.

Note K: Business Segment Reporting

As a result of the Distribution discussed in Note B, the Company's primary operations now
comprise three business segments: Advanced Electronics, Marine Engineering and Production, and
Interconnect Products.

The Advanced Electronics segment designs, develops and manufactures inertial navigation, guidance and
control, command, control and communications and electronic warfare systems. The fiscal year 1994
Advanced Electronics segment operating profit includes the effects of the settlement of a civil suit (see
Notes I and J).

The Marine Engineering and Production segment is involved in the design, construction and overhaul of
naval ships.

Intersegment sales, sales between geographic areas and export sales are not material. All internal sales and
transfers are based on negotiated prices.

The U.S. Government is a significant customer of both the Advanced Electronics and Marine Engineering
and Production segments (see Note I).

In the first quarter of fiscal year 1994, the Company named its other businesses "Interconnect Products" to
reflect the principal products of this group of businesses. This segment manufactures and distributes 
interconnection subsystems, electronic connectors, printed circuit boards, backpanels and soldering
materials to diverse markets worldwide. Operating profit for fiscal year 1994 includes a charge recorded to 
adjust the net assets of a division to net realizable value in connection with its possible sale or closure.

Costs for Corporate and Other Amounts include net interest expense and foreign currency adjustments.
Assets classified as Corporate and Other Amounts consist primarily of cash and marketable securities,
deferred tax assets and, for fiscal years 1993 and 1992, net assets of WAI of $1,085 million and $1,042
million, respectively. In fiscal year 1994, the Company used cash and marketable securities to effect an
early extinguishment of debt as discussed in Note C.

protection and diaper products.
During 1993/94, the European

Dry Thins and Pampers Trainers.

~ New Tissue/Towel Business-~
More recently, P&G expanded its


growth oppor-
tunities in
Europe by
entering the
$5.5 billion
tissue/towel
market with
the July 1994


acquisition of VP-Schickedanz.  This
is the Company's first move into the
tissue business outside North
America.  VPS has an experienced
organization with modern manufac-
turing facilities and high quality,
profitable brands such as Tempo, the
leading European paper handker-
chief, and Bess bath tissue, the lead-
ing brand in Germany.  Based on
proven technology and successful
brands in the U.S., along with sig-
nificant growth potential in a market
where per capita tissue usage is well
below U.S. levels, we expect to signif-
icantly build this business over time.

~ Eastern Europe continued its
strong growth with volume up 20%
in 1993/94.  Laundry detergents are
the Company's largest business in
this region.  P&G is the market leader
in the Czech and Slovak Republics,
with brands such as Tix, Tide and
Ariel.  In Russia, Tide is the best-sell-
ing western laundry detergent after
only six months on the market.
  Pampers is the number one diaper
in Hungary and Poland and is a
strong second in the Czech and Slovak
Republics.  P&G also strengthened its
dentifrice business in 1993/94.


Blend-a-Med is the number one den-
tifrice brand in Hungary and Poland.

~ Asia/Pacific recorded 25% vol-
ume growth, led by gains in China,
Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea,
Indonesia, Thailand and India.
  Japan remains the largest business
in Asia/Pacific and set new volume
records, despite a tough competitive
climate and weak economic condi-
tions.  The introduction of the new
Vidal Sassoon hair care line was
a major factor in the broad-based
growth in this region.  Feminine
protection products were also an
important contributor.
  China was the fastest-growing
country in the region.  P&G
is China's market leader in hair care
and, with the completion of three
joint ventures during this fiscal year,
is now the largest detergent manufac-
turer in China, as well.  Our other
Chinese businesses -~ Skin Care,
Feminine Protection and Personal
Cleansing -~ are also growing.

~ Latin America continued broad-
based volume growth.  Mexico deliv-
ered the biggest volume gains on
existing businesses, while acquisitions
played an important role in the growth
of other Latin American markets.
  The Company strengthened its
position in the feminine protection
category with the acquisition of the
Higibras/ProHigiene companies in
Brazil.  In addition, we expanded our
core laundry and dishwashing business
through acquisition of the Quimica
and Llauro companies in Argentina.

~ Canada continued to build its
Laundry and Cleaning business
with the introduction of Tide with
Advanced Color Guard.  Paper led
Canada in unit volume growth as
P&G's technologies were applied to
the Royale bath tissue, kitchen towel
and facial tissue products.


"P&G people are characterized by their
innovation, speed and ability to work
together across both functional and
geographic boundaries."


International

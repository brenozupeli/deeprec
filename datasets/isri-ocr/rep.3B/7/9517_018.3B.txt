Becoming a force in the PC business  Personal Information Products Group


HP's PC business came of age in 1994.  The Personal Information Products
Group (PPG) achieved outstanding growth, won greatly increased
recognition and entered important new markets.  To build on this year's
success, PPG will stay focused on delivering high-value products at
aggressive prices through a complete range of reseller channels.

PPG produced some of HP's most gratifying successes in 1994.  Desktop PC and
server sales grew dramatically; profitability improved; and emerging markets, such
as Korea and Eastern Europe, were strong.  The PC-networking business offered
leading technology and made significant inroads in a growing market.  In an exciting
new segment, TCI and Comcast, two of the largest U.S. cable-TV operators, announced
their intention to use PPG's digital set-top terminals in their interactive TV offerings.

There were several common elements in PPG's success: feature-rich products priced
at or below the competition, focused organizations that moved quickly, a commit-
ment to customer satisfaction and a strong Channel Partners Program. PPG's focus
on customer satisfaction helped HP achieve the highest ranking in the prestigious
J.D. Power and Associates 1994 study of customer satisfaction among desktop
PC business users.* The group's channel strength was reflected in the annual survey
conducted by Computer Reseller News, a top trade publication for resellers, in
which HP finished first in more categories than any other company.

Sun Company Today


Sun Company, Inc. 
is one of the largest U.S.
oil companies and the largest inde-
pendent U.S. refiner/marketer. The company
operates five domestic refineries and is engaged in retail gasoline marketing
principally in the northeastern U.S.; lubricants and petrochemicals sales
worldwide; and domestic pipelines and terminals operations. Sun also pro-
duces crude oil and natural gas internationally and is the majority owner of
Suncor Inc., a fully integrated Canadian oil company. We employ 14,500
people in the U.S. and around the world, and 106.7 million shares of Sun 
common stock are held by 59,000 shareholders.

As we enter 1994, Sun expects a year of increased market recognition, stem-
ming in part from such signal accomplishments as the addition of new retail
outlets along the Pennsylvania Turnpike and in western Massachusetts; the
introduction of lubricants and petrochemicals into new markets; and consoli-
dation of our branded fuels into one marketing name-~SUNOCO.~~

Shareholders' Equity
Employee Stock Purchase Plan  Eligible company employees may generally contribute up to 10 percent of their base
compensation to the quarterly purchase of company stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  Under this plan,
employee contributions are partially matched with company contributions on a quarterly basis to purchase HP stock.
At October 31, 1994, approximately 83,000 employees were eligible to participate and approximately 41,000 employees
were participants in the plan.

Incentive compensation plans  The company has three principal stock option plans, adopted in 1979, 1985 and 1990.  All plans
permit options granted to qualify as "Incentive Stock Options" under the Internal Revenue Code.  The exercise price of a stock
option is generally equal to the fair market value of the company's common stock on the date the option is granted.
Under the 1990 Incentive Stock Plan, however, the Executive Compensation and Stock Option Committee, in certain cases,
may choose to establish a discounted exercise price at no less than 75 percent of fair market value on the grant date.
In 1994 and 1993, discounted options totaling 216,000 shares and 741,000 shares, respectively, were granted at no less than
75 percent of fair market value on the grant date.  Stock compensation expense related to the discounted options was
not material.  Options generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant
except for discounted options, which may not be exercised before the fifth anniversary of the option grant date, at
which time such options become 100 percent vested.  The plans provide for the granting of stock appreciation rights
with respect to options granted to officers.  The company has not included stock appreciation rights with options granted
to officers since October 31, 1991.

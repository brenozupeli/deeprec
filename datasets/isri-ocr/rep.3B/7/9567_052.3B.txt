The Company had $500 million of credit facilities as of
December 31, 1993 in the form of revolving credit agree-
ments from commercial banks which provide for revolv-
ing credit through August 1996. These facilities support
Sun's commercial paper borrowings. All of the above 
facilities are subject to commitment fees, the amounts of
which are not material. As of December 31, 1993, there
were no borrowings against these revolving credit agree-
ments. The Company also has access to short-term financ-
ing under non-committed money market facilities. At
December 31, 1993, $60 million was borrowed through 
these facilities.

At December 31, 1993, Suncor had a revolving term
credit facility available for its own use aggregating ap-
proximately $302 million. Committed revolving credit
will be available through October 1998. The facility pro-
vides for commitment fees, the amounts of which are not
material. At December 31, 1993, $91 million was bor-
rowed against this facility which was classified as long-
term debt as it is Suncor's intention to refinance that
amount on a long-term basis (Note 12).

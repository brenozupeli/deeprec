	Teams at Work


Chrysler approves and pays bills.  Still another found a better way for the company to buy washroom paper
towels and tissue products.
	At Chrysler's Twinsburg, Ohio, Stamping Plant, a team of employees turned damaged, obsolete machinery
into a valuable piece of equipment capable of moving the plant's large stamping presses, helping the plant
improve its scheduling flexibility and reducing press downtime. At our Kokomo, Ind., Casting Plant, a team of
employees developed a system that reduced the cost for treating wastewater from $3.38 per gallon to as low
as 61 cents per gallon.
	Employees in Chrysler's zone office in Cincinnati, Ohio, initiated an effort pulling together sales, service and
parts specialists into a team that spends one week in a dealership observing operations, interviewing employees
and working with the dealer to develop a plan to improve sales and service performance.
	More than 1,000 hourly employees from Chrysler's Belvidere, Ill., Assembly Plant traveled to the Chrysler
Technology Center, where they worked in the pilot plant to help build the prototype vehicle for the Neon.  And


along the way, they also had a lot of input into the design of the tooling and equipment
that would go into the plant.
	Sometimes, the accomplishments are individual achievements.  Chrysler buyer Mary
Francino found a way to get parts to dealers in Hawaii and Alaska faster and save about
$1 million a year in the process.  Dennis Danko from Chrysler's Detroit Axle Plant found a
way to reduce the weight of axle shafts by 11 ounces.
	In each of these examples and thousands of others, employees are eliminating waste,
improving product quality, streamlining processes, making a better product or enhancing
customer satisfaction-~one improvement at a time.
	That's the work of the 100,000-plus Chrysler employees in North America and


around the world.
	It's a job that will never end.

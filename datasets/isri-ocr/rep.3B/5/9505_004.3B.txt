  Demand outside the U.S. was flat, though there were a few bright spots.  In the Pacific Rim, sales
were up $303 million; sales in Canada were up $159 million.  In anticipation of the economic impact of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), two major Mexican construction companies ordered nearly
$100 million worth of Cat machines in late 1993.  And in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), we
regained much of the ground lost during the U.S. embargo of the Soviet Union a decade ago, with orders for
nearly $200 million worth of machines.
  Truck engine sales were another success story -~ especially in North America, where our participation
in the heavy-duty truck business increased by four percentage points, moving us solidly into the number two slot
in that industry segment.
  Increased demand was an essential ingredient to the year's success.  But we were able to capitalize
on it because of our global strategies.

Corporate Reorganization

When we overhauled our corporate structure in 1990, we sought to accomplish two things -~ sharpen customer
focus and maximize return-on-assets (ROA).  The evidence for 1993 is in -~ and it shows we've been able to do both:
~ We continued improving our product line in 1993, introducing 46 new products or product upgrades.  Many of
them have been in short supply because of their popularity.
~ The quality of our products is better than ever. Early hour failures, a key industry measurement of quality, were
at an all-time low.
~ Capital spending came in under budget for the third consecutive year as managers in each division carefully
weighed each capital expenditure against its potential for return-on-assets.

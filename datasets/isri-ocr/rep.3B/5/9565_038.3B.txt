At December 31, 1994, 33,428,296 shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance pursuant to stock plans, options and conver-
sions of preferred stock.

Attached to each outstanding share of the company's common 
stock is one Right. The Rights will be exercisable if a person
or group acquires beneficial interest of 15% or more of the com-
pany's outstanding common stock, or commences a tender or
exchange offer for 15% or more of the company's outstanding
common stock. Each Right will entitle stockholders to buy one 
one-thousandth of a share of a new series of participating pre-
ferred stock of the company at an exercise price of $200. The
Rights will expire on December 18, 1997. In the event of certain
merger, sale of assets or self-dealing transactions, each Right will
then entitle its holder to acquire shares having a value of twice
the Right's exercise price. The company may redeem the Rights 
at $.01 per Right at any time until the 15th day following public 
announcement that a 15% position has been acquired.

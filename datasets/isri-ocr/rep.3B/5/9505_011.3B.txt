  Established in 1925, Caterpillar Tractor Co. quickly positioned itself as a major
  global player. That early success was the result of important manufacturing and marketing
  strategies inherited from our predecessor companies, Holt and Best.
  We pioneered products for agriculture and road-building, then construction and mining.
  We developed diesel engine technology.  We helped make it possible to build a better world.


We manufactured superior products -~ highly productive machines and engines that were built to last.


  We took care of our customers by taking care of the products we sold them.
Through our worldwide network of dealers, Cat customers benefited from quick access
to quality parts and service.  By 1930, that global network was already several hundred
dealers strong.
  Those strategies worked well -~ for Caterpillar, for our dealers, and for our
customers. But, in the 1980s, the world changed -~ growth slowed or stopped, our


customers competed for a dwindling amount of work, demand for our equipment plummeted, and we
faced new, non-U.S. global competitors.  Rejecting calls for quick fixes, we took the long-term view.
  Protecting our worldwide share of industry sales, we began building a new, more customer-
based corporate culture.  With modernized factories, we increased manufacturing efficiencies. With
decentralization, we tapped into our most important resource -~ empowering our people to make more
decisions. With new approaches to product development, we gave customers newer products more often.


By 1993, we had become a customer-driven company, able to respond as well to
customer demands as to fluctuations in the business cycle.
A leading global competitor -~ ready for the 21st century.

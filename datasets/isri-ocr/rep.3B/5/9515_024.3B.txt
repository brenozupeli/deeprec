   GMHE's business mix in 1993, 1992, and
1991 was as follows:


      GMHE BUSINESS MIX
                   1993   1992   1991
Automotive          33%    32%    32%
Telecommunications  
  & Space           16     16     16
Defense             45     45     46
Commercial           6      7      6


Diverse mix indicates GMHE growth potential.

  GMHE also provides direct support to GM
by supplying components and technologies for
GM vehicles.
  In July 1993, GMHE sold its 30% ownership
interest in the Japan Communications Satellite
Company which resulted in a $89.7 million pre-
tax gain.  In December 1993, GMHE sold Hughes
Rediffusion Simulation Limited and related
entities which resulted in a pre-tax loss of
$55.0 million.
  Amounts for 1992 include a $28.0 million
pre-tax gain on the sale of assets to Hughes-JVC
Technology Corporation and $35.0 million of
pre-tax income from a patent infringement set-
tlement.  In August 1992, GMHE acquired the


missile business of General Dynamics Corpora-
tion (GD) for 21.5 million shares of Class H
common stock valued at $450.0 million and cash
of $62.8 million.  Subsequently, GD sold those
shares as part of a 29.1 million share public
offering of Class H common stock.  The principal
purpose of the offering was to broaden the pub-
lic trading market for Class H shares and thereby
increase their liquidity.  The remaining 7.6 mil-
lion shares were issued by GM, and the proceeds
were used for general corporate purposes.
  Earnings (Loss) per share attributable to
Class H common stock were $2.30 in 1993,
($2.29) in 1992, and $1.39 in 1991, and are
based on the Available Separate Consolidated
Net Income (Loss) of GMHE (described in Note
9 to the Financial Statements).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The return to overall profitability in 1993 resulted
in much stronger cash flow from operations
this year compared with the previous two years.
The Corporation's net losses in 1992 and 1991
had adverse effects on cash flow and balance
sheet strength during those periods.  Despite
negative business conditions during this period,


GM was able to meet its funding needs through
outside borrowings, sale of finance receivables,
equity issuances, sale of assets, sale and
leasebacks, and other means.
  In 1992 and 1991, GM's earnings were
inadequate to cover its fixed charges (principally
interest and related charges on debt), primarily
as a result of losses incurred by NAO.  The
Corporation is implementing fundamental changes
which it believes will restore the profitability of
those operations and enable the Corporation to
have earnings sufficient to cover its fixed charges,
as was the case in 1993.

Cash Flows

GM had its strongest cash position ever at
year-end.  Cash and cash equivalents, including
GMAC, were $13,790.5 million at December 31,
1993, up from $11,078.6 million a year earlier
due to net cash provided by operating and
investing activities exceeding net cash used in
financing activities.
  Cash and cash equivalents at December 31,
1993 with GMAC on an equity basis were
$9,762.5 million, up from $7,207.6 million a
year earlier.  The increase was due to an excess
of net cash provided by operating and investing
activities over net cash used in financing activities.
  Net cash provided by operating activities,
including GMAC, was $14,655.8 million in 1993.
$9,990.9 million in 1992, and $6,498.5 million
in 1991.  Net cash provided by operating activities
with GMAC on an equity basis was $11,406.3
million in 1993, $6,699.6 million in 1992, and
$4,674.9 million in 1991.
  The provisions for plant closings and other
restructurings represented $950.0 million, $1,237.0
million, and $2,820.8 million of noncash
charges to income in 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively.  The Corporation's plant closing and
restructuring reserve (excluding environmental)
at December 31, 1993 was $4,120.6 million.
Approximately $3,788.0 million of this total
represents employee job security and facility
holding costs which will require future cash
outflows, generally spread evenly over the next
six years.  Such cash flows will be influenced by
the Corporation's ability to manage its work force
efficiently and effectively within and across geo-
graphic areas during this period.  As a result of
the improved alignment of plant capacity and
market demand, the Corporation expects to
achieve improved operating results and cash flows.
  Net cash provided by (used in) investing
activities, including GMAC, was $457.4 mil-
lion in 1993, $1,542.8 million in 1992, and
($2,798.9) million in 1991.  GMAC received
$13,072.2 million in 1993, $11,201.8 million in
1992, and $2,926.9 million in 1991 from pro-
ceeds from sales of finance receivables.  Such
sales, which are an integral element in GMAC's
strategy to minimize liquidity concerns, acceler-
ate the conversion of receivables to cash.  With
GMAC on an equity basis, net cash provided by
investing activities amounted to $2,465.0 million

COMMITMENT


In 1993, Abbott Laboratories continued its long-standing commitment
to the community.  Community education programs and preservation of the environment
are two areas where Abbott invested significant resources.


Supporting Education
For over 25 years, Abbott has supported a variety of
education programs, with a special emphasis on attracting
students to the technical and scientific fields that serve as
the backbone of Abbott Laboratories.
  "Girls and Science: Linkages for the Future" encourages
young women to enter science and engineering.  In conjunc-
tion with the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (AAAS) and with volunteer support from
Abbott employees, the company sponsored training work-
shops for Girl Scout councils in Illinois and Wisconsin at
the corporate headquarters.  AAAS instructors taught troop
leaders how to conduct hands-on science and math experi-
ments.  The program will potentially reach more than
20,000 Girl Scouts.  More than 30 Abbott scientists and
engineers volunteered to act as role models for the troops.
  In Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, Abbott is underwriting a
similar AAAS program focusing on science and math skills
for Hispanic students.  Fifty elementary school teachers
learned a variety of scientific experiments appropriate for
their classrooms and will share their training with other
teachers.  Abbott also donated materials and is providing
technical support from Abbott employee volunteers.
  "Advancing Minorities' Interest in Engineering (AMIE):
A Coalition of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and
Fortune Companies," a newly created alliance, is the outcome
of an Abbott-sponsored initiative.  Together, member cor-
porations and the nine historically black schools in the
U.S. are working to increase the opportunities available for
minorities to pursue and succeed in engineering careers.
  "CHOICES" is a program presented to ninth-graders by
trained Abbott employee volunteers who visit students in
their classrooms.  Through exercises and discussions, these
volunteers help children understand that staying in school
gives them more choices in life.  CHOICES is an excellent
example of how the educational and business communities
can work together to prepare students for adult life.

Caring for the Environment
Abbott's corporate philosophy is that business leaders also
must be environmental leaders, and that the company's
actions today will have an impact on future generations.
The company focuses on the three "Rs" of environmental


protection: reduce, reuse and recycle.  Abbott continually
assesses thousands of manufacturing processes, products
and packages to determine how they can be made more
environmentally friendly.
  Reducing the volume of material put into a product helps
to lower manufacturing and disposal costs.  For example,
decreasing the width of a plastic wall by only a fraction of
an inch in a disposable cartridge used in an Abbott Vision
blood analyzer takes on new significance when that piece is
reproduced several hundred thousand times each year.
  One of the best alternatives to disposing of waste
is selling it to another company that can use it in a
manufacturing process.  For example, some Abbott manu-
facturing byproducts are used to clean printing presses and
in windshield washer solvent.
  In the U.S., Abbott recycles approximately 30 million
pounds of material each year.  Approximately one-third of
this amount is paper and cardboard boxes.  The remainder
includes plastic, glass, aluminum and steel.

Abbott Donations
Abbott donations include both products given to worldwide
relief efforts and cash contributions made to educational,
health, human service, civic and cultural organizations.
Employee gifts to hospitals, schools and public broadcasting
stations are matched dollar-for-dollar by the company.
  Generous employee and corporate gifts to United Way
fund-raising campaigns at Abbott facilities totaled
$4.5 million in 1993.
  In 1993, The Clara Abbott Foundation, which is incor-
porated as an independent entity, awarded more than
$5 million in educational grants to the children of Abbott
employees and retirees in 1993.  The foundation also pro-
vided Abbott employees and retirees with funds to meet
unexpected financial difficulties such as medical expenses
and loans to replace homes damaged by natural disasters.

Equal Employment Opportunity
It is the policy of Abbott Laboratories to provide equal
opportunity in all areas of its employment practices without
regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age,
ancestry, citizenship, disability, veteran status, marital status,
sexual orientation or any other reason prohibited by law.

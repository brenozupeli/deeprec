subsidiaries. The valuation allowance for 1993 and 1992 relates to the uncertainty as to the realization of
certain deferred tax assets, including U.S. tax credit carryforwards, state and local net operating loss
carryforwards and net deferred tax assets, and net operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Based upon anticipated future results, the Company has concluded, after consideration of the valuation
allowance, that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset balance will be realized.
  In the third quarter of 1993, Grace recorded the effects of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993
(OBRA), which was enacted in August 1993. Among other things, OBRA increased the highest U.S. Federal 
corporate tax rate to 35%, effective January 1, 1993. However, neither this increase in the U.S. Federal
corporate tax rate (from 34%), nor the other provisions of OBRA, had a material effect on Grace's results of
operations.
  The 1992 effective tax rate increased to 43.1% (before the above provision for the valuation allowance) as
compared with 39.6% in 1991, largely due to the additional costs of repatriating to the U.S. a higher level of
earnings of foreign subsidiaries and an increase in state income taxes.
  See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes.

Loss from Discontinued Operations
In 1993, Grace restated its financial statements to reflect the classification of certain businesses as discontinued
operations. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
During 1993, the net pretax cash flow provided by Grace's continuing operating activities was $301.6 million
versus $358.9 million in 1992, primarily due to the use of $44.1 million of net cash to repurchase accounts
receivable in 1993, as compared to the receipt of $96.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of accounts
receivable in 1992, and a net cash outflow of $103.1 million relating to asbestos in 1993 (see below for
further discussion), compared with a net cash outflow of $70.3 million in 1992. Also, in 1993 cash flow
provided by operating activities includes $67.9 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate hedge
agreements. After giving effect to discontinued operations and payments of income taxes, the net cash provided 
by operating activities was $243.1 million in 1993.
  Investing activities used $151.9 million of cash in 1993, largely reflecting capital expenditures and business
acquisitions and investments, primarily in the health care and water treatment businesses. During 1993, Grace 
acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Home Intensive Care, Inc. for approximately $129 million (inclusive
of related costs). These investing activities were offset by net proceeds of $464.8 million from divestments
(mainly those of Grace Energy's oil and gas operations). Management anticipates that the level of capital 
expenditures in 1994 will increase to approximately $350 million as compared to the $309.6 million of capital
spending in 1993. Capital spending is expected to be concentrated on Grace's core businesses.
  Net cash used for financing activities in 1993 was $105.9 million, primarily reflecting the payment of
$128.4 million of dividends. Total debt was approximately $1.7 billion at year-end 1993, a decrease of $113.1
million from year-end 1992. Grace's total debt as a percentage of total capital (debt ratio) decreased from
54.1% at year-end 1992 to 52.9% at year-end 1993, primarily as a result of the reduction in total debt.
  In January 1993, Grace sold $300 million principal amount of 7.4% Notes Due 2000. The net proceeds 
from the sale of these Notes were used to repay commercial paper and bank borrowings.
  In the third quarter of 1993, Grace completed the redemption in full of its outstanding Liquid Yield Option
Notes due 2006 (LYONs) and 6~~~% Convertible Subordinate Debentures Due 2002. Of the $1,012.5 million 
principal amount at maturity of LYONs outstanding, approximately 31% ($309.6 million) was converted into 2.8
million shares of common stock; the remaining LYONs ($702.9 million) were redeemed for approximately $258
million in cash. Substantially all of the $150 million principal amount of the 6~~~% Convertible Debentures due 
2002 outstanding immediately prior to redemption was redeemed for cash (equal to the principal amount
outstanding).
  Grace expects to satisfy its 1994 cash requirements from the following sources: (1) funds generated by
operations, (2) proceeds from the sales of businesses and (3) financings. Such financings could include new
borrowings, the availability and cost of which will depend upon general economic and market conditions. 

Asbestos-Related Matters
As reported in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Grace is a defendant in lawsuits relating to 
previously sold asbestos-containing products. In 1993, Grace paid $103.1 million in connection with the

PHARMACEUTICAL & NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS


  Key medical nutritional products also
include Jevity, a tube-feeding product;
Glucerna, for patients with abnormal
glucose tolerance; Nepro for hemodialysis
patients; and Perative and AlitraQ with
glutamine, two products for critically
ill patients.
  To expand the U.S. retail market for
Ensure products, Abbott launched a
national radio, television and print advertis-
ing campaign emphasizing the benefits of
good nutrition and nutrition's cost-effective
role in overall health care, particularly for
older adults.
  In international markets, Ensure, Jevity,
Glucerna and an array of other specialized
products increasingly are being used by
patients recovering from surgery or those
with other medical problems.  Over the
last five years, sales of medical nutritional
products have grown steadily in Europe,
while experiencing strong growth in Japan,
Canada and several countries in Latin
America and Asia.
  Abbott continues to seek growth oppor-
tunities with the introduction of new, more
effective feeding devices to support its
medical nutritional products.  Introduced
in 1993, the Flexiflo Lap G Laparoscopic
Gastrostomy Kit uses laparoscopy, a mini-
mally invasive technique, for gastrostomy
tube placement.  A second procedural kit
using laparoscopic technology for feeding
tube placement is expected to be intro-
duced in 1994.
  The Quantum pump, introduced in
1992, has gained excellent market acceptance
as an innovative, effective device for enteral
feeding.  The automated system has a self-
flushing capability, which decreases the
incidence of tube-clogging.  This feature
improves feeding efficiency and reduces
labor costs.

Pediatric Nutritionals
With its well-established Similac and
Isomil brands, and a broad line of products
for the special nutritional needs of infants
and children, Abbott is the leading infant
formula manufacturer in the U.S. The
company maintained its leadership posi-
tion in 1993 despite highly competitive
market conditions.


  Abbott has responded to changing
market conditions with new products and
marketing approaches.  A line extension
was introduced for Abbott's Isomil brand,
the leading soy formula in the U.S. Isomil
DF (Diarrhea Formulation), a patented
product, was launched as the first infant
formula clinically shown to shorten the
duration of loose, watery stools during
diarrhea in infants.
  For the special nutritional needs of
children ages 1 to 10, Abbott introduced
PediaSure With Fiber.  The product helps
normalize bowel function.  Both PediaSure
and PediaSure With Fiber provide complete
liquid nutrition for children with chronic
conditions that prevent normal eating or
require long-term tube feeding.  The
products also may be used for children
recovering from trauma or illness, in
preparation for or recovery from surgery,
or as an everyday nutritional supplement
with or between meals.
  A new system of 17 highly specialized
nutritionals designed for the nutritional
management of infants, children and adults
with metabolic disorders was launched in
1993.  The Ross Metabolic Formula System
provides nutritional products necessary
from birth through adulthood for patients
who must observe lifetime dietary restric-
tions to avoid serious developmental
problems.  These products are sold on the
recommendation of physicians.
  Also introduced was Pedialyte Bubble
Gum Flavor, a pleasant-tasting oral elec-
trolyte solution for maintenance of fluids
and minerals lost in diarrhea, a potentially
dangerous condition for infants and children.
  Pedialyte Bubble Gum Flavor helps
to improve compliance, especially among
toddlers and older children for whom
flavor may be an issue.  The Pedialyte line of
products is being promoted nationwide in
television and print advertisements.
  In international markets, the company
continues to expand its infant nutritional
business with new products and further
penetration of emerging markets in
Latin America and the Pacific Rim.  Gain,
Abbott's follow-on formula for older babies,
is achieving excellent growth in several
international markets, including Taiwan,
the Philippines and Hong Kong.

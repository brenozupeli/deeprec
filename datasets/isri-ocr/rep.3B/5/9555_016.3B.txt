Management's Discussion and Analysis
 

Strategic and financial objectives

Management's primary objective is to
increase shareholder value over time. To
achieve this objective, the Company has
implemented a long-term business strategy
which focuses on continuing aggressive
investment in new cereal markets, increasing
returns on existing investments, maximizing
cash flows, and minimizing the cost of 
capital through appropriate financial policies.
The success of this strategy is reflected in 
the Company's superior earnings, return on
equity, total return to shareholders, and
its overall strong financial condition.

Global marketplace

Because of its strong global market share
leadership, the Company is uniquely posi-
tioned to benefit from the continued in-
crease in cereal consumption around the 
world. As of December 31, 1993, our
market share was 43% globally, 38% in 
North America, 47% in Asia-Pacific, 50%
in Europe, and 78% in Latin America. This 
favorable positioning in existing markets 
is accompanied by leadership in entering
new markets with substantial long-term
potential. Kellogg opened a new cereal
plant in Latvia in 1993 and has plants sched-
uled to begin production in India in 1994
and in China in 1995. We plan to make our 
products available to a billion new con-
sumers by early in the next century, more
than doubling our present reach.

Lifestyle and demographic changes in major
markets around the world favor a continued
increase in consumption of ready-to-eat ce-
real, our core product line. Two particularly
important trends are ever-increasing recogni-
tion by consumers around the world of the
nutritional value of cereal and the accelerat-
ing move of the "baby boom" generation 
from young adulthood, where cereal con-
sumption is relatively low, to middle age,


where cereal consumption grows steadily.
The Company believes it has developed 
the worldwide infrastructure and financial
resources needed to continue its leader-
ship of category growth.

Revenues
Kellogg revenues are obtained primarily from
the sale of ready-to-eat cereals in more than
150 countries. Kellogg has been marketing
cereals since 1906 and is the global market
share leader by nearly a three-to-one advan-
tage. Increased revenues are obtained by 
reaching consumers in both new and devel-
oped markets with products that are both
nutritious and superior in quality. The intro-
duction of new products is vital to the 
Company's long-term financial strength. For 
1993, the Company introduced 24 new 
products worldwide.

Despite intense competition, continued 
recessions in several major markets, and unfa-
vorable currency movements, worldwide
revenues increased by 2% for 1993, marking 
the 49th consecutive annual increase. The
increase was achieved through higher selling 
prices and a 2% increase in cereal volume,
being negatively impacted by foreign 
currency movements. Forty percent of all
revenues are derived from outside the
United States and are subject to foreign cur-
rency fluctuations. Excluding the negative
effects of currency movements, 1993 sales
would have increased 6%. During 1993,
sales within the United States rose by 6%
from increased selling prices and volume
for both cereal and convenience foods.

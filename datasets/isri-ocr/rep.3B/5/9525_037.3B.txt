Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(tabular dollars in millions except per share amounts)
Note 1 -~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Significant accounting policies are discussed below, and where
applicable, in the Notes that follow.
  Principles of Consolidation.  The financial statements
reflect the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and its con-
trolled affiliates.  Intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.  Investments in affiliates in which PepsiCo exer-
cises significant influence but not control are accounted for by
the equity method, and the equity in net income is included in
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated
Statement of Income.  Certain other reclassifications were made
to prior year amounts to conform with the 1993 presentation.
  Marketing Costs.  Marketing costs are reported in Selling,
general and administrative expenses and include costs of adver-
tising, marketing and promotional programs.  Promotional
discounts are expensed as incurred, and other marketing costs
not deferred are charged to expense ratably in relation to
sales over the year in which incurred.  Marketing costs deferred
consist of media and personal service advertising prepayments,
materials in inventory and production costs of future media
advertising; these assets are expensed in the year used.
  Cash Equivalents.  Cash equivalents represent funds
temporarily invested (with original maturities not exceeding
three months) as part of PepsiCo's management of day-to-day
operating cash receipts and disbursements.  All other investment
portfolios, primarily held outside the U.S., are classified as short-
term investments.
  Net Income Per Share.  Net income per share is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares and share equivalents outstanding during each year.
  Research and Development Expenses.  Research and
development expenses, which are expensed as incurred, were
$113 million, $102 million and $99 million in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.

Information regarding industry segments and geographic areas
of operations is provided on pages 27 through 29.

Note 3 -~ Unusual Items
In 1993, PepsiCo recorded a charge of $29.9 million ($0.04 per
share) to increase its net deferred tax liabilities, as required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109),
"Accounting for Income Taxes," for the 1% statutory rate
increase under U.S. tax legislation enacted in 1993.  (See Note 13.)
  Unusual charges, principally for restructurings, totaled
$193.5 million in 1992 ($128.5 million after-tax or $0.16 per
share) and $170.0 million in 1991 ($119.8 million after-tax
or $0.15 per share).  In 1992, PepsiCo adopted the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (SFAS 106), "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"
and SFAS 109 effective December 29, 1991.  (See Notes 10 and 13.)
As compared to the previous accounting methods, the adoption
of SFAS 106 and SFAS 109 reduced 1992 operating profit by
$72.8 million ($19.3 million after-tax or $0.02 per share).  Infor-
mation regarding the effect of these actions on comparability
of operating profits is provided on page 27.


Note 4 -~ Acquisitions and Investments in Affiliates
During 1993, PepsiCo completed a number of acquisitions and
affiliate investments in all three industry segments aggregating
$1.4 billion, principally comprised of $1.0 billion in cash and
$335 million in PepsiCo Capital Stock.  Approximately $307 mil-
lion of debt, including capital lease obligations, was assumed
in these transactions, more than half of which was subsequently
retired.  This activity included acquisitions of domestic and
international franchised restaurant operations, the buyout of
PepsiCo's joint venture partners in a franchised bottling opera-
tion in Spain and the related acquisition of their fruit-flavored
beverage operation, the acquisition of the remaining 85% inter-
est in a large franchised bottling operation in the Northwestern
U.S., the acquisition of a regional Mexican-style casual dining
restaurant chain in the U.S. and equity investments in certain
franchised bottling operations in Argentina and Mexico.
  During 1992, acquisitions and affiliate investment activity 
aggregated $1.4 billion, principally for cash. This activity
included acquisitions of international (primarily Canada) and
domestic franchised bottling operations and a number of
domestic and international franchised restaurant operations, the
buyout of PepsiCo's joint venture partner in a Canadian snack
food business and an equity investment in a domestic casual
dining restaurant chain featuring gourmet pizza. In addition, 
PepsiCo exchanged certain previously consolidated snack food
operations in Europe with a net book value of $87 million for
a 60% equity interest in an international snack food joint venture
with General Mills, Inc. PepsiCo secured a controlling interest
in its Mexican cookie affiliate, Gamesa, through an exchange of
certain non-cookie operations of Gamesa for its joint venture
partner's interest.
  During 1991, acquisition and affiliate investment activity aggre-
gated $804 million, principally for cash, led by acquisitions of
domestic franchised restaurant operations.
  The acquisitions have been accounted for by the purchase
method; accordingly, their results are included in the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements from their respective dates of
acquisition.  The aggregate impact of acquisitions was not mate-
rial to PepsiCo's net sales, net income or net income per share;
accordingly, no related pro forma information is provided.

Note 5 -~ Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (computed on the
average, first-in, first-out or last-in, first-out methods) or net
realizable value.  The cost of 41% of 1993 inventories and 44% of
1992 inventories was computed using the last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method.  Use of the LIFO method increased the 1993 total year-
end inventory amount below by $8.9 million, but reduced the
1992 amount by $3.4 million.


1993  1992
Raw materials, supplies and in-process    $463.9   $388.1
Finished goods ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~        460.8    380.7
                                          $924.7   $768.8


  PepsiCo hedges certain raw material purchases through com-
modity futures contracts to reduce its exposure to market price
fluctuations.  Gains and losses on these contracts are included
in the cost of the raw materials.

wholesale and term loans declined $159.5
million from 1992 levels.
  Total financing revenue amounted to $10,402.1
million in 1992, a 6.7% decrease from 1991.
Revenue from retail and lease financing was
$5,507.0 million, down 20.5%, while revenue
from leasing operations increased 29.2% to
$3,527.9 million.  Financing revenue from whole-
sale and term loans remained relatively stable
at $1,367.2 million.
  Insurance premiums earned by Motors Insur-
ance Corporation totaling $1,107.2 million
decreased $52.5 million and $80.5 million
from 1992 and 1991 levels, respectively.
  Interest and discount expense declined 19.0%
to $4,721.2 million in 1993 and 14.8% to $5,828.6
million in 1992 as a result of the continued down-
ward trend in U.S. interest rates and the lower
level of borrowings.  Net interest margin (including
depreciation expense) declined $815.1 million
to $1,328.8 million in 1993 and $262.5 million
to $2,143.9 million in 1992, reflecting lower
earning asset levels attributable to GMAC's asset
securitization strategy and narrowing spreads
in the U.S.  This was partially offset by wider
spreads in GMAC's international operations.
  Total earning assets of GMAC were $74,783.8
million at December 31, 1993, down 14.2% from
year-end 1992.  The reduced level of earning assets
reflects lower financing levels of new GM cars
and trucks in the U.S. in 1993, as well as the
sales of receivables.  During 1993 and 1992, 
GMAC sold and securitized finance receivables
with principal amounting to $13.6 billion and
$12.0 billion, respectively.


  In the U.S., GMAC financed 28% of new GM
vehicles delivered by GM dealers during 1993,
down 5 percentage points from 1992 and 
7 percentage points from 1991.
  GMAC's total borrowings were $62,773.2
million at December 31, 1993, a 15.8% decrease
from the prior year-end.  Approximately 80.0%
of 1993 borrowings supported United States 
operations.
  The provision for financing losses amounted
to $300.8 million in 1993, a decrease of
$70.2 million and $747.1 million from 1992
and 1991, respectively, reflecting a lower level
of finance receivables outstanding, a $275 mil-
lion pre-tax nonrecurring special wholesale loss
provision in 1991, and better loss performance
trends in all segments of GMAC's businesses.

EDS

EDS achieved record earnings for the eighth con-
secutive year, reflecting continued strong perfor-
mance in its existing businesses as well as growth
in new markets.  Separate consolidated net income
increased 13.9% to $724.0 million in 1993 and
16.1% to $635.5 million in 1992 over $547.5
million in 1991.  Earnings per share attributable
to Class E common stock were $1.51 in 1993
and $1.33 in 1992, up from $1.17 before the
cumulative effect of an accounting change in 
1991, and are based on the Available Separate
Consolidated Net Income of EDS (described in
Note 9 to the Financial Statements).
  EDS is a world leader in systems integra-
tion and communications services.  Revenues from
sources outside GM and its affiliates rose 7.5%
in 1993 to $5,238.1 million and 30.3% in 1992


to $4,870.4 million and comprised 61.2% and
59.3%, respectively, of all EDS revenues.  In addi-
tion, EDS continued to assist GM in a variety of
re-engineering processes being implemented in
the Corporation's factories and offices.
  EDS financial statements do not include the
amortization of the $2,179.5 million initial cost
to GM of EDS customer contracts, computer soft-
ware programs, and other intangible assets,
including goodwill, arising from the acquisition
of EDS by GM in 1984.  This cost, plus the
$343.2 million cost of contingent notes purchased
in 1986, less certain income tax benefits, was
assigned principally to intangible assets, includ-
ing goodwill, and is being amortized by GM over
the estimated useful lives of the assets acquired.
Such amortization, charged against Other Sector
income, was $34.9 million in 1993 and 1992,
and $169.4 million in 1991.

GMHE

GMHE reported earnings of $921.6 million in
1993.  This compares with a loss of $921.6
million in 1992 which included the restructur-
ing charge and accounting changes for post-
retirement benefits and revenue recognition
described previously, and earnings of $559.4
million in 1991 which included the accounting
changes for general purpose spare parts and
income taxes described previously.  Excluding
these special items, GMHE earnings in 1992
and 1991 would have been $699.9 million and
$505.0 million, respectively.
  Revenues increased 9.9% to $13,517.5 million
in 1993 and 6.6% to $12,297.1 million in 1992.
Revenue increases in 1993 were primarily due
to a full year of operations of the missile
business acquired in August 1992 and to the
increased production volumes and electronic
content per vehicle in the automotive electronics
segment.  The improvement in operating results
was due to the aforementioned revenue increase,
cost reductions, and improved margins in both
the automotive electronics and defense segments.
  GMHE participates in four major business
segments: automotive electronics, telecommuni-
cations and space, defense electronics, and com-
mercial technologies.  Revenues for the automo-
tive electronics sector were $4,491.6 million,
up 12.7% from $3,985.8 million in 1992 and
$3,660.4 million in 1991.  Telecommunications
and space revenues were $2,178.0 million, a
13.0% increase over the 1992 total of $1,927.9
million and a 17.9% increase over 1991.  Defense
electronics revenues for 1993 were $6,112.1
million compared with $5,547.0 million in 1992
and $5,325.1 million in 1991.  Commercial
technologies 1993 revenues were $735.8
million, a 12.0% decrease from 1992 but a
4.0% increase over 1991.

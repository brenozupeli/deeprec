"We asked employees to suggest ways to eliminate waste or add value
in everything we do," says Andy Mosier, associate director of global


business development.
More than 3,000 sug-
gestions flooded in.
One of them was to
reassign technicians
like Rhett Newman to
individual production


teams so that they would be directly involved in the manufacturing 
process. Thanks to this and other improvements, Mead Johnson figures
Project FOCUS has saved over $24 million to date. And many of the
savings have been plowed right back into the business. Mr. Mosier 
credits the company's new efficiency with making it possible to launch
Next Step Toddler Formula in the U.S. on an accelerated schedule in July.

EVERYONE AIMS FOR QUALITY  Ordinarily, a purchasing
manager would have been named to lead the team formed to remedy a
production problem at ConvaTec's plant in Greensboro, North Carolina.
That's because the difficulty was traced to a raw material from an outside


vendor that went into one of ConvaTec's 
DuoDERM adhesive wound dressings.
But when the team was set up in 
late 1993, it was headed instead by
Sandra Thomas-~an operator on the
bandage line. "We applied what we
had learned in the company's Total
Quality Leadership (TQL) program,"
says Ms. Thomas, one of four opera-
tors in the group. "We gathered data
to prove the problem. Then we 
worked with the vendor to fix it."
Giving greater responsibility to 
people like Ms. Thomas is one way
the TQL program seeks continuous 
gains in quality and customer satis-
faction. "TQL reinforces values
ConvaTec already had," says Joe
Solari, ConvaTec president. "We 
are known as a caring and dynamic
place, and we attract people who
want to be part of that."


Mead Johnson Nutritional 
Group challenged workers
like technical operators 
Diane Huett (right) and
Kevin Allyn to come up
with ways to boost 
efficiency, and they did
-~suggesting some 3,000 
improvements that have 
led to savings of $24
million so far.

STOCKHOLDERS LETTER

a semi-synthetic process to eliminate the need to produce 
TAXOL from the bark of the Pacific yew tree. All these 
continued the advance of this important new therapy.

We also received FDA approval to market Serzone
(nefazodone), our new antidepressant, which was also
successfully introduced in Canada, and Zerit (d4T),
our third AIDS medication. We also anticipate that
Glucophage (metformin), our new oral anti-diabetes
agent for Type II non-insulin dependent diabetes, a 
product licensed from the French company Lipha in 
1994, will be marketed soon.

We expect Pravachol to benefit worldwide in the
wake of several pivotal trials-~including the PLAC
II study announced in August-~that show substan-
tial benefit to people with known heart disease, by
reducing coronary events by nearly two-thirds and
reducing total mortality.

Dermatology product sales were very strong.
Lac-Hydrin 12% Lotion continued to set records
for new prescriptions. Westcort became the number
one branded topical steroid in it class with pediatri-
cians in the U.S. Dovonex, for psoriasis, also
achieved excellent sales in its first full year on the
market and became Westwood-Squibb's leading brand.

To extend the reach of our products, we entered 
into and agreement with Cephalon to co-market
Stadol NS to neurologists for the treatment of 
migraine and other moderate to severe pain.

Estrace is now the third best selling estrogen
replacement therapy on the U.S. market-~thanks in 
part to the fact that it has the lowest oral dose indi-
cated for preventing osteoporosis. Recent studies have 
bolstered hopes that estrogen replacements also may 
cut women's risk of heart disease.

In Latin America, we entered a new therapeutic area
with the launch of Bristaflam, a licensed non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

Despite market conditions, we are certain that those
companies who believe strongly in the importance of 
innovative pharmaceuticals will continue to succeed
in the future. This year, Bristol-Myers Squibb spent
nearly $1 billion on pharmaceutical R&D alone.
Our goal: to develop drugs that can be first or

Robin Coleman of
North Chicago, Ill.,
has put more than
700 hours of 'sweat
equity' into her
home, which is
being built through
the Abbott chapter
of Habitat for
Humanity. Here
she consults with
volunteer Kris Kelly
(left) and Jim
Donovan, Habitat's
president in Lake
County and an
Abbott employee.
Robin and her four
children will move
in this April.


One of the many
groups supported by
Abbott employee
volunteers is Habitat
for Humanity, an
organization that
builds homes for low-
income families.  In
1993, more than 500
employees volunteered
to provide the labor
for the construction of
a home in Columbus,
Ohio, and another in
Lake County, Ill.
Abbott donated cash
to finance the average
cost of materials.

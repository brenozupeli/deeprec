For PepsiCo's key international operations, located in Australia,
Canada, Japan, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom (U.K.),
the translation effects of exchange rate movements on earnings
have historically been largely offsetting.  The effects on com-
parability of sales and operating profits arising from translation
of the income statements of international businesses are identi-
fied, where material, in Management's Analysis of consolidated
and segment operating results.  These translation effects exclude
the impact of businesses in highly inflationary countries, where
the functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
  Changes in currency exchange rates also result in foreign
exchange gains and losses, reported as a component of unallo-
cated expenses, net (see page 28).  For 1993, 1992 and 1991, net
foreign exchange losses totaled $41.2 million, $17.4 million and
$7.8 million, respectively.  These reported amounts include net
translation losses arising from remeasurement into U.S. dollars
of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary
countries, as well as net transaction losses.  Cash flow transaction
gains and losses arise from current assets such as receivables
and short-term investments as well as payables (including debt)
denominated in currencies other than a business' functional cur-
rency.  In implementing strategies to minimize financing costs,
the effects of expected currency exchange rate movements on
debt and short-term investments are considered along with
related interest rates in measuring effective net financing costs.
  Beginning in 1993, Mexico is no longer categorized as highly
inflationary.  PepsiCo has not calculated the net foreign exchange
loss that would have been reported in 1993 had businesses in
Mexico been accounted for as highly inflationary; however,
translation losses for businesses in Mexico were not a significant
component of the above 1992 and 1991 amounts.


Accounting Changes in 1992
PepsiCo's financial statements reflect the noncash impact of the
1992 early adoption of two required Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards, No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Post-
retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106) and No.
109 "Accounting for Income Taxes"  (SFAS 109). The cumulative
effect of adopting SFAS 106, a $575.3 million charge ($356.7 mil-
lion after-tax or $0.44 per share), represented estimated future
retiree health benefit costs related to services provided by
employees prior to 1992.  As compared to the previous account-
ing method, the adoption of SFAS 106 reduced 1992 operating
profit by $52.1 million ($32.3 million after-tax or $0.04 per
share). See Note 10 for additional details regarding the adop-
tion of SFAS 106.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109, a
$570.7 million tax charge ($0.71 per share), primarily repre-
sented the recognition of additional deferred tax liabilities
related to acquired identifiable intangible assets as of the begin-
ning of 1992.  As compared to the previous accounting method,
the adoption of SFAS 109 reduced 1992 operating profit by
$20.7 million, but the provision for income taxes was lower by
$33.7 million, resulting in a $13.0 million increase in net income
($0.02 per share).  See Note 13 for additional details regarding
the adoption of SFAS 109.

U.S. Tax Legislation Enacted in 1993
U.S. federal income tax legislation enacted in August 1993
includes provisions for a 1% statutory tax rate increase and the
reinstatement of the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC) program,
both effective for the full year.  The increase in the tax rate
resulted in a noncash charge of $29.9 million ($0.04 per share)
for the adjustment of net deferred tax liabilities, as required
under SFAS 109.  The 1993 provision for income taxes also
included $7.3 million ($0.01 per share) for the effect of the tax
rate increase on current year earnings, partially offset by the
benefit of the TJTC reinstatement.
  The new tax legislation also includes a provision, effective
for PepsiCo beginning on December 1, 1994, to reduce the tax
incentives associated with operations in Puerto Rico.  This
change will limit the tax benefit on income earned in Puerto
Rico in the first year to 60% of the amount allowed under the
previous tax law, with the limit further reduced ratably over the
following four years to 40%.  Had the provision become effective
at the beginning of 1993, earnings for the year would have been
reduced by approximately $54 million or $0.07 per share.  This
impact does not reflect any possible mitigating actions that
PepsiCo is currently exploring.

GRACE Davison 


Consumers never see Grace Davison technology, but it makes possible efficient transportation
fuels, reliable low-cost packaging materials, high-quality coatings, better food products and much
more. Grace Davison is the world's leading supplier of petroleum fluid cracking catalysts, which
are critical to the production of gasoline and other refined petroleum products. Its polyolefin
catalysts are essential to the manufacture of polyethylene, which is used in packaging film and in 
pipe. Grace Davison silica and zeolite adsorbents are value-added components used in a wide 


range of industrial and consumer applications.
The Genesis of a Catalyst
Value is designed into Grace Davison fluid cracking catalysts (FCCs)
at every step of their evolution, from initial contact with the refiner to
actual use in the fluid catalytic cracking unit.
  The genesis of a new catalyst is rooted in the close relationship 
that Grace Davison nurtures with its customer. Initially, the Grace


Davison sales/technical team develops operating objectives. Does the refiner need to
maximize gasoline production? Reduce emissions? Maximize olefin output for reformulated 
gasoline? What are the operating constraints?
In Search of a Solution
After studying the variables, the team selects two or three possibilities for the refiner. With the
greatest manufacturing flexibility in the FCC business, Grace Davison can choose from a 


virtually unlimited number of catalyst formulations.
  Now the intense analytical work begins. The technical service
engineer prepares yield estimates. If the performance assessment isn't


good enough, R&D investigates and designs new catalysts
in Grace Davison pilot plants. Meanwhile, manufacturing 
and quality assurance weigh in to ensure that the 


catalyst meets stringent product qualifications.
  The final package presented to the customer is


honed by Grace Davison refining experts to deliver
the best catalyst value available.

catalysts to upgrade oil to more 
valuable transportation fuels such
as gasoline and jet and diesel fuel.

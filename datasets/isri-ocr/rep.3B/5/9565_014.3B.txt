Business.

FINANCIALS  We ended the year with over $2.4
billion in cash and marketable securities and share-


holders' equity totaling $5.7 billion.
An aggressive stock repurchase pro-

per share. Cash flow remains strong
and the company is one of only a 
handful of corporations that merit a
triple-A credit rating from both 
Moody's and Standard and Poor's.

A PHARMACEUTICAL SALES REVOLUTION  To
stay ahead of the radical changes now taking place in the health care
marketplace, U.S. Pharmaceuticals dramatically restructured its sales
organization in 1994. The group first consolidated its five primary sales
forces-~Princeton Pharmaceutical Products, Bristol Laboratories, E.R.
Squibb, Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals and Mead Johnson Laboratories
-~under a single command. Then it redeployed them, appointing 12
regional business directors to coordinate activities in different regions
of the country and dividing the representatives themselves into three-
member teams, each of which can represent the full range of Bristol-
Myers Squibb primary care therapies in a single customer interaction.


"Changes like this help us serve key institutional 
customers, such as large health plans, hospital pur-
chasing consortia and university medical systems,"
explains Steve Greco, the regional director for
California. "Now we align ourselves as partners with
our customers. We try to find the best drugs for
them, whether that means a name brand like Pravachol
or a multi-sourced medication from Apothecon, the
company's generics division." While the overall size 
of the sales force fell from 2,250 to 1,500, other
operations grew larger-~including those that serve 
managed care plans and hospital and institutional
sales. And the company maintained its existing sales
forces in fields like oncology, which demand special-
ization. "We focus on the customer as never before,"


says Scott English, senior territory sales manager for Santa Barbara
County in California. "Recently, we organized a pain management sym-
posium to introduce care providers to Stadol NS, our nasal spray-delivered
pain reliever. This kind of value added service is what the new organiza-
tion allows us to do. It's good for the company, and it's great for patients."


"To make this work,
we emphasize team-
work, training and
the use of information
technology," adds 
Samuel L. Barker, 
Ph.D., president of 


U.S. Pharmaceuticals. "Our teams work together closely to meet
customers' needs. They are trained to keep abreast of our large and
growing product line. And every sales representative is connected,
via a laptop computer, to an information network that gives them
instant access to the data they need to make them an effective 
partner with the customer. This combination of information and
empowerment has increased the effectiveness of our sales representa-
tives." And, by the way, the satisfaction of customers.


U.S. Pharmaceuticals sales representative Cynthia Banks visits the
Rutgers Health Plan, a large health maintenance organization in 
New Brunswick, New Jersey. Ms. Banks and other sales represen-
tatives can now handle the entire line of Bristol-Myers Squibb prod-
ucts, and they can retrieve pricing, stock and other data instantly
by using a laptop computer to dial into a central database.


THE PHARMACEUTICAL SALES FORCE HAS
BEEN COMPLETELY REENGINEERED TO
MEET THE NEEDS OF DEMANDING NEW
CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING LARGE-VOLUME
BUYERS LIKE MANAGED CARE PLANS
AND HOSPITAL CONSORTIA.

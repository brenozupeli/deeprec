International Automotive Operations

GM's International Automotive Operations (IO)
were profitable in 1993 and 1992, although
results trailed the high profit levels achieved
in 1991.  Income of IO before accounting changes
was $1,224.9 million in 1993 versus $1,514.5
million in 1992 and $1,468.7 million in 1991.
Results in 1993 reflected record sales and prof-
its in GM's Latin American Operations (LAO).
Europe remained profitable despite an extremely
difficult economic climate, but profits were below
1992 levels.  The decline in 1993 earnings was
primarily attributable to a European car market
decline of 16.5%.
   During 1993, Europe's vehicle unit deliveries
declined by 10.5%, although GM increased its
car and truck market share to 12.6% in 1993
from 11.8% in 1992 and 11.3% in 1991.  By
increasing its overall passenger car market share
to 13.4% in 1993, up from 12.7% in 1992, and
12.2% in 1991, GM maintained second place 
among all manufacturers of passenger cars in
Western Europe.  This was the fifth straight year
of increased market share for Opel/Vauxhall in
Western Europe.  The technically identical Opel/
Vauxhall model range maintained its number
one position in the Western European car market
in 1993.  Opel's market share increased in 13
different countries.  The successful launch of
the new Corsa attributed significantly to this
favorable market share development, while the
Astra was again GM's largest selling model line


in Europe, maintaining its position as the second-
best-selling car in Europe.
   Progress was made in restructuring Saab's
operations during 1993.  Improvements in cost
efficiency and productivity ensured a successful
launch in 1993 of the new Saab 900, Saab
Automobile AB's first all-new product since the
joint venture company was established in 1990.
   LAO's performance exceeded all previous
records on sales and financial fronts.  By capital-
izing on market openings throughout the region,
with all-time record deliveries of over 402,000
units (up 28% vs. 1992), GM was able to
maintain its market share at 18%.  Led by GM
do Brasil's sales increase (45%), LAO was able
to post all-time record net income and operating
profits and records were also established in GM
operations in both Venezuela and Colombia.
GM Chile also achieved its second best year in
history.  LAO is poised for the future as it re-
established its manufacturing presence in Argentina
to take advantage of market growth.  All this
was accomplished amidst substantial political
uncertainty and increased competitive pressures
from Eastern European and Asian entries.
   While attaining an 18% increase in unit
deliveries in 1992 (versus 1991) to 314,000
units, GM continued to strengthen its financial
position in Latin America by posting record
operating profit as well.  The region also benefited
from a relatively low effective tax rate in 1993.
   Improved sales in Brazil, as well as record
sales in Chile and Ecuador, combined with


significant year-to-year increases in Venezuela,
Colombia, and Argentina, all contributed to GM's
18.0% regional market share -~ its highest over-
seas.  Sustained levels of sales and profitability
in Latin America are highly dependent upon
economic and political conditions in the region.
   In the Asia-Pacific region, financial perfor-
mance was favorable despite substantial new
business development costs incurred in expand-
ing GM's operations in the rapid-growth econo-
mies of China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia.  In
Japan, the re-launch of Opel products in
partnership with Yanase & Company resulted in
record sales.  In Taiwan, local assembly of the
very popular Opel Astra commenced in May 1993
and, in September, a joint venture was formed
in Indonesia, where assembly of Opel models
is planned for 1994.  The VR Commodore
launched in mid-1993 by GM Holden's was
named Car of the Year in Australia.

GMAC

GMAC, in its role as a partner with General
Motors and GM dealers, serves the financing
and insurance needs of GM customers.
   Reference should be made to the condensed
GMAC financial statements included in Note 12
to the Financial Statements.
   Consolidated net income of GMAC for 1993
totaled $981.1 million, an increase of $45.0
million over 1992.
   Earnings for 1992 reflect an unfavorable
cumulative effect of an accounting change related
to implementation of SFAS No. 106 which reduced
1992 net income by $282.6 million. Excluding the
nonrecurring impact of SFAS No. 106, GMAC's 1993
earnings declined by $237.6 million year to year.
   Net income of $1,369.7 million in 1991
included a $331.5 million favorable cumulative
effect of an accounting change relative to imple-
mentation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, and a $170.9 million after-tax special
wholesale loss provision.  Excluding special items,
1992 income was $1,218.7 million compared to
$1,209.1 million in 1991.
   Net income from financing operations totaled
$790.6 million in 1993, compared with $1,011.6
million in 1992, excluding the cumulative impact 
of SFAS No. 106.  The decrease in earnings in
1993 is primarily attributable to lower asset
levels and tighter net interest rate margins in
North America (net of depreciation expense on
operating lease vehicles), partially offset by
higher earnings outside North America.
   Net income from financing operations in 1992
compared favorably with 1991 levels of $865.9
million (excluding the cumulative impact of
SFAS No. 109) due to a special wholesale loss
provision reported in 1991.
   Total financing revenue was $8,752.0 million
for 1993, $1,650.1 million below 1992 amounts.
Revenue from retail and lease financing was
$3,673.4 million, down 33.3%, while revenue
from leasing operations increased 9.7% to
$3,870.9 million.  Financing revenue from

  The 1991 amounts above were calculated under the previous
accounting method.  The 1991 deferred provision arose prin-
cipally from accelerated expense recognition for tax purposes
as compared to financial reporting and included amounts related
to depreciation of property, plant and equipment of $56.2 mil-
lion, amortization of intangibles of $49.0 million and increased
prefunding of employee benefits of $23.3 million, partially offset
by $41.7 million related to restructuring charges.
  Tax benefits associated with exercises of stock options totaled
$23.4 million in 1993, $57.5 million in 1992 and $8.5 million in
1991.  These amounts were credited to shareholders' equity.  A
change in the functional currency of operations in Mexico from
the U.S. dollar to local currency in 1993 resulted in a $19.3 mil-
lion decrease in the net deferred foreign tax liability that was
credited to shareholders' equity.

  PepsiCo operates centralized concentrate manufacturing
facilities in Puerto Rico and Ireland under long-term tax incen-
tives.  The foreign amount in the above table includes approxi-
mately 50% (consistent with the allocation for tax purposes) of
the income from U.S. sales of concentrate manufactured in
Puerto Rico.

  "Other current liabilities" ~~~~~~~~~      23.9       44.2
  "Deferred Income Taxes" ~~~~~~~~~      2,007.6    1,682.3

  The valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets rose by
$67.7 million in 1993 and $38.5 million in 1992, which offset
higher deferred tax assets arising primarily from increased net
operating loss carryforwards.  The net operating loss carryfor-
wards largely relate to a number of foreign and state jurisdictions
and expire over a range of dates.
  The deferred tax liability for Safe Harbor Leases (the Leases)
is related to transactions, which PepsiCo entered into in 1981
and 1982, that decreased income taxes paid by PepsiCo over the
initial years of the Leases and are now increasing taxes payable.
Additional taxes paid in 1993 related to the Leases totaled
$6.4 million, and taxes payable are estimated to be $40.5 million
over the next five years.  The provision for income taxes is not
impacted by the Leases.
  Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for bases
differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries
and joint ventures.  These differences, which consist primarily
of unremitted earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested,
aggregated approximately $3.2 billion at year-end 1993 and
$2.4 billion at year-end 1992, exclusive of amounts that if
remitted in the future would result in little or no tax under
current tax laws and the Puerto Rico tax incentive grant. Deter-
mination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities
is not practicable.

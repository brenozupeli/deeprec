operating costs were partially
offset by modestly higher net pric-
ing (principally at domestic KFC)
and increased franchise royalty
revenues.  Domestic profits rose
$87 million or 15%, while inter-
national profits declined $28 mil-
lion or 23% reflecting weakness
in Australia.
  Pizza Hut's worldwide sales
increased $525 million or 15%
to $4.1 billion.  The domestic
operations represent the major
portion of worldwide Pizza Hut.
Additional units contributed $392
million to the worldwide sales
increase.  Volume growth provided
about $140 million, driven by
strong domestic gains resulting
from the national rollout of the
new value-priced Bigfoot Pizza in
the second quarter.
  Comparable sales for domestic
company-owned units (same
store sales) advanced 5%, though
volume growth was slightly
higher.  This performance
reflected growth in all three
distribution channels: delivery,
carryout and dine-in.  Improved
sales in both delivery and carryout
were driven by the success of
Bigfoot.  The growth in dine-in
reflected the impact of the third
quarter 1992 rollout of the
all-you-can-eat pizza and salad
lunch buffet.  Results late in 1993
indicate a softening of same
store sales trends in dine-in due
primarily to lapping last year's
rollout of the lunch buffet.
  Pizza Hut's worldwide profits
advanced $37 million or 11%
to $372 million.  This profit per-
formance reflected about $55 mil-
lion from volume growth, $41
million from additional units,
increased franchise royalty reve-
nues and higher international net
pricing.  These benefits were par-
tially offset by increased store
operating costs as well as admin-
istrative and support expenses,
which included the start-up
costs associated with Bigfoot.
Bigfoot contributed significantly
to U.S. profit growth as incre-
mental volume, net of estimated
cannibalization of other products,

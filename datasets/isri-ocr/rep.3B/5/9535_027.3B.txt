Note 5 -~ Taxes on Earnings
(dollars in thousands)
Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This statement
requires that deferred income taxes reflect the tax conse-
quences on future years of differences between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.
Prior to 1993, provisions were made for the estimated amount
of income taxes on reported earnings which were payable
currently and in the future.  The effect of this change on
income before taxes and net income was not significant, and
prior years' financial statements have not been restated.
  U.S. income taxes are provided on those earnings of for-
eign subsidiaries and subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico
under tax incentive grants, which are intended to be
remitted to the parent company.  Undistributed earnings
reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries as working
capital and plant and equipment aggregated $702,000 at
December 31, 1993.  Deferred income taxes not provided
on these earnings are not significant.


Earnings before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes
on earnings, are as follows:


Earnings Before Taxes           1993         1992         1991

Foreign                      463,067      320,418      338,339
Total                     $1,943,230   $1,738,753   $1,544,222

Total                          $544,104   $499,696   $455,545


Differences between the effective income tax rate and the
U.S. statutory tax rate were as follows:


                                         1993    1992    1991
Statutory tax rate                       35.0%   34.0%   34.0%
Benefit of tax exemptions in
Puerto Rico and Ireland                  (6.7)   (6.1)   (5.6)
State taxes, net of federal benefit       1.7     2.1     2.2

Effective tax rate                       28.0%   28.7%   29.5%


As of December 31, 1993, total deferred tax assets were
$632,112 and total deferred tax liabilities were $211,839.
Valuation allowances for tax assets are not significant.  The
major temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax
assets are compensation and employee benefits ($146,505),
valuation and exposure reserves for inventory and accounts
receivable ($86,003 and $91,329, respectively), deferred
intercompany profit ($72,129), and state income taxes
($30,715).  The use of accelerated depreciation for U.S.
income tax purposes ($165,482) and employee benefits
($32,578) are the primary temporary differences that give
rise to deferred tax liabilities.

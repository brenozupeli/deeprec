STRENGTHENING ESTABLISHED COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES


  Beech completed its flight test program of the Mk II trainer, its
contender for the prime contract to provide the U.S. Air Force and Navy with
a new Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS). Beech will build the
Mk II trainer airframe in Kansas, ensuring that domestic content on the
program is at least 90 percent.
  Beech was awarded a U.S. Army contract for five RC-12P electronic
intelligence aircraft, a military version of the Super King Air B200. In
addition, Beech was awarded a subcontract to modify seven special mission
RC-12N aircraft to bring them up to the latest "12P" configuration and desig-
nation. Beech Aerospace Services was awarded a one-year, $18 million Air
Force contract to furnish management, equipment, personnel, and services to 
support the 14th Flying Training Wing mission at Columbus Air Force Base.
Four annual options raise the total potential award value to $91 million.

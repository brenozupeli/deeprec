  3M continues to build on its impressive base in adhesives with
innovations in technology and even closer relationships with cus-
tomers.  Major growth opportunities include:
  ~ Next-generation structural adhesives, which are used in con-
struction and manufacturing.  As manufacturers use more synthetic
materials, such as plastics and composites, adhesives will play an
even greater role.  Over the coming years, much of the growth in 3M's
adhesives business will come through the replacement of traditional
fastening systems, such as rivets, welds, nuts and bolts.
  ~ Flexible adhesives, used in laminations and veneers.
  ~ Film adhesives, used in auto and aerospace manufacturing.
  ~ Improved hot-melt adhesives, which are safer for the environ-
ment because they contain no solvents.


  3M's success as a supplier of specialty adhesives demands that
the company work closely with customers, understanding their needs
and the materials they use.  Today, we help customers solve problems
with their current products, and we help them design for the future.
For the aerospace industry, the company is working on adhesives for
the next generation of airplanes.  3M is also developing products for
the computer industry, where product offerings change rapidly.
  3M's global presence is a major competitive advantage.  Customers
want a supplier that can meet their needs worldwide.  3M is ready,
virtually anywhere in the world, to provide not only the products they
need, but also technical support and worker training.
  In Europe, 3M has strengthened its position in box-sealing and
masking tapes, large and growing market segments.
  In the Asia Pacific area, markets are opening rapidly.  3M has
recently built or expanded adhesives manufacturing operations in
Japan, Korea, Australia, India and China.
  In Latin America, the company is already the leading tape
manufacturer in such major markets as Brazil and Mexico and is
extending its reach throughout the region.
  In Canada, a new tape plant in Ontario began operation in 1993.
It is expected to be 3M's most efficient plant for producing general-
purpose masking tapes.
  A tradition of customer service, an unmatched technology base
and a global presence help ensure that 3M will continue to be a world
leader in adhesives technology.

Lighting
 
We remain in the forefront of an industry
that is experiencing technological revolution.


1993 was one of the most dynamic years in GE
Lighting's history.  We had close to double-digit
earnings growth, before restructuring costs, on
stable revenues as we continued global expansion
and development of high-technology products
for increased energy efficiency and light quality.
We again made major gains in productivity, with
increased employee involvement in cycle-time
reductions and quality enhancements.  Over the
past two years, we have cut our product develop-
ment-to-market cycle by half, and we aim to re-
duce this cycle by an additional 50%.
  Our technology efforts continue to be focused
on the fastest-growing energy-saving lighting
products, including the popular compact fluores-
cents.  Our investment in technology produced a
significant number of new products -~ up 75%
in 1993.  During the past five years, we added
more than 300 types of energy-saving lamps, and
our sales of these rose nearly 200% each year.
  Key to this achievement is the involvement of
global program teams located in our major mar-
kets.  To accelerate top-line growth in consumer,
commercial and industrial markets, we formed a
New Product Ventures organization to develop
and sell specialty lighting products.  The team's
goal is to be fast, flexible and quick to market.
  Equally significant to our 1993 success was
continued strategic globalization.  We agreed to
form a joint venture in China, GE Jiabao Light-
ing Company, Ltd., to manufacture, distribute
and sell a full line of lighting products in Chi-
na's fast-growing, $550 million lighting market.
   We also strengthened our position in Japan
with the start-up of Hitachi GE Lighting, Ltd.
This joint venture has introduced 75 different
lamp types to the Japanese market, providing
major export opportunities for GE plants in
North America and Europe.  The JV now serves
the $2 billion Japanese lighting market through
some 100 distributors, who have more than 400
offices and supply about 10,000 Hitachi retail
outlets.  In India, our GE Apar Lighting venture
continued to expand with investments in new fa-
cilities and in the only "ribbon" glassmaking
equipment in India or Southeast Asia.  Additional
ventures in Thailand and Indonesia position us
as a clear leader in this fast-growing region.


  In Europe, we enjoyed increased market share
and substantially improved revenue and earnings
growth despite a slow economy.  Tungsram, the
Hungarian lampmaking company we acquired in
1990, had an exceptional year.  It is now profitable
and fully integrated into our European opera-
tions, where we are continuing our emphasis on
customer service and productivity and on new
product introductions.  Sales volume for our new
compact fluorescents expanded by more than
200%.  In addition, we strengthened our position
in Scandinavia by acquiring Lumalampan AB's
well-regarded Luma brand.  These actions are ex-
pected to increase our participation in the Euro-
pean market in the coming years.
  We also maintained our leadership in North
America by introducing high-technology prod-
ucts and innovative marketing programs that im-
prove retailers' and distributors' profitability.  Our
Lighting Systems business had an especially good 
year, with double-digit earnings growth and in-
creased sales of fixtures.  Our South American
sales increased through strategic investment, spe-
cial marketing programs, new energy-efficient
products and improved operational efficiencies.
  GE Lighting remains in the forefront of an
industry that is experiencing technological revo-
lution in its products and innovation in its cus-
tomer service in every market of the world.

Weyerhaeuser Financial Services
Weyerhaeuser Mortgage Company and its subsidi-
aries are primarily engaged in the mortgage banking
industry and also offer insurance services.
 ~ Mortgage notes held for sale are stated at the
lower of cost or market, which is computed by the
aggregate method (unrealized losses are offset by
unrealized gains).  Hedging transactions are entered
into to protect the inventory value from increases
in interest rates.  Hedge positions are also used to
protect the pipeline of loan applications in process
from increases in interest rates.  Hedging gains and
losses realized during the commitment and ware-
housing period are deferred to the extent of unrealized
gains on the related mortgage loans held for sale.
 ~ The costs associated with purchasing mortgage
servicing rights are deferred.  Excess service fees
result from loan sales in which WMC retains the
loan servicing rights and are based on the present
value of future servicing revenue less a normal ser-
vicing fee, based upon the estimated remaining life
of the loans sold.
  The Mortgage Securities Corporations were formed
for the limited purpose of issuing collateralized mort-
gage obligation bonds (CMO bonds) secured by
Government National Mortgage Association and
Federal National Mortgage Association certificates.
The CMO bonds are the sole obligation of the
issuer, and neither the company nor any affiliated
company has guaranteed or is otherwise obligated
with respect to the CMO bonds.
 ~ The mortgage-backed certificates are carried
at par value adjusted for any unamortized discount
or premium.  These discounts or premiums are
amortized using a method that approximates the
effective interest method over the estimated life of
the underlying mortgage loans.
 ~ CMO bonds are carried at unamortized cost.
Discounts and premiums are amortized using a method
that approximates the effective interest method over
their estimated life.


  In March 1992, Republic Federal Savings and
Loan Association, which was a federally chartered
savings and loan institution that operated primarily
in Southern California, sold the remainder of its
branches, ceased accepting deposits as a federally
chartered savings and loan institution, and filed an
application with the Office of Thrift Supervision to
undergo a voluntary dissolution, which was approved
in the fourth quarter of 1992.  During its operation:
 ~ Interest income was recorded on the accrual
method; however, interest was not accrued on loans
that were more than 90 days contractually delinquent
and on certain other loans that management felt
may not be recoverable.
 ~ U.S. government and other securities were carried
at amortized cost.  Gains or losses were recognized
upon realization.
 ~ Discounts on loans purchased were amortized
into income over the expected average loan lives.
  In April 1993, WFS completed the sale of
GNA Corporation.  As a part of that transaction,
Weyerhaeuser assumed $225 million of outstanding
GNA debt.  GNA Corporation and its life insurance
subsidiaries provided annuities, insurance and securi-
ties marketed through financial institutions.  Dur-
ing its operation:
 ~ Payments received on investment and limited
payment contracts were recorded directly as deposits.
 ~ Investment income was recorded when earned.
 ~ Investments in bonds were stated at amortized
cost; mortgage loans and other investments were
carried at cost.
 ~ The liability for future annuity and contract
reserves on single premium deferred annuities and
single premium whole life policies was the contract
holder's account value. The reserve for single premium
immediate annuity benefits was the present value of
such benefits.

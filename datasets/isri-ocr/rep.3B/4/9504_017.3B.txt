aircraft, to be designated the E-767 (see below).
  Boeing has developed a market strategy for
its maritime patrol aircraft product line and is
exploring opportunities in this area. The com-
pany is seeking contracts to upgrade the United
Kingdom's Nimrod patrol aircraft. Boeing is
also teamed with Tracor to pursue a contract to
improve the mission systems on board the U.S.
Navy's P-3 aircraft.
  ARGOSystems, a subsidiary of the Defense
& Space Group, builds electronic warfare and
signal intelligence components for domestic
and international markets.
Helicopters. The V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, which is
being developed by Boeing and Bell Helicopter
Textron, continued flight testing in 1993. Fabri-
cation of four production-representative aircraft


will begin in 1994, with a first flight planned for
December 1996 (see page 19).
  Boeing is teamed with Sikorsky to build
three prototypes of the U.S. Army's RAH-66
Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter,
with the first flight scheduled for November
1995. The current Army requirement is for ap-
proximately 1,200 Comanches, which gives the
program good long-term potential.
  Modifications to the Boeing Chinook heli-
copter continue for the U.S. Government and
international customers. During 1993, Boeing
delivered 43 modified helicopters. The British
Royal Air Force and the Royal Netherlands Air
Force have ordered 16 new and remanufactured
Chinooks, and Boeing plans to increase its inter-
national sales effort for the Chinook.


767 AWACS


For nearly two decades, the Boeing
Airborne Warning and Control System
(AWACS) has been the world's stan-
dard for airborne early warning sys-
tems. A military version of the 707
had served as the AWACS platform un-
til the 707 production line closed in


1991.  That same year, Boeing began
offering a modified 767 commercial
airframe for future AWACS, and the
program was launched with an order
of two 767 AWACS from the Japanese
government in November 1993.


The 767 offers many advantages over
the 707, including greater range and
payload. Other nations expressing in-
terest in the 767 AWACS include
Italy, South Korea and Saudi Arabia.
The potential market for military
derivatives of the 767, including
AWACS, tankers and maritime patrol,
is estimated as high as 100 aircraft.

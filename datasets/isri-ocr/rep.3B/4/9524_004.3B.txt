3M creates a continuous stream
of successful new products by
giving its scientists and
technicians the freedom and
resources to do their jobs.  3M
invested more than $1 billion in
research and development in
1993; R&D spending now has
totaled $4.6 billion over the past
five years.


A 3M product is born through the combination of
creative people, shared technologies and a customer
need.  Although the results can be as different as Post-
it~~ Notes and ScotchgardTM Protectors, the 3M process
of research and development is uniquely consistent.  It
stems from a culture in which ideas, methods and tools
transcend business-unit boundaries so that company
scientists and technicians can draw from the full range
of 3M technological resources.  They find encourage-
ment to take risks with the recognition that an inven-
tive effort is seldom wasted, even if it produces an
outcome different from the one expected.
  In the following pages, you'll learn how products
emerge when an existing 3M technology gets stretched
by imagination, experimentation or the desire to solve
a particular customer problem.  Technologies involving
adhesives, nonwoven materials and specialty chemicals
have provided the platforms from which a majority
of 3M product lines have been launched or extended.
More recent technologies, such as microreplication and


optics, are providing similar platforms.  In many cases,
3M products are so innovative that they change the
basis of competition, and their unique attributes com-
monly earn patent protection.
  At 3M, product development works in tandem with
marketing, as the story of the Scotch-BriteTM Never
RustTM Wool Soap Pad on page 16 demonstrates.
Products with the greatest sales and profit potential are
developed faster through high-priority "pacing pro-
grams." Manufacturing processes are continuously
refined to cut cycle time, reduce waste and minimize
energy usage.  Customer relationships are strengthened
and leveraged through leading-edge service initiatives
and through integrated, customer-focused sales efforts.
With companies in 58 countries, 3M is able to get new
products to market quickly and efficiently worldwide.
  With a long tradition of providing products that help
people around the world work and live better, 3M is
sustaining this legacy through a continuing focus on
innovation, growth and profitability.

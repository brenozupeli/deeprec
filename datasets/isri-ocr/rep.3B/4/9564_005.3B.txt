alleviating automobile congestion. Early this year, Raytheon and IBM-Brazil
submitted a bid to the Brazilian Ministry of Aeronautics to supply an
environmental monitoring system for the Amazon region. This project, called
SIVAM, demonstrates Brazil's vision in guarding natural resources and
promoting prudent land use that's good for the economy.
  In addition to expanding defense technology into the commercial 
arena, Raytheon also is applying commercial technology in the defense arena.
Right now, we are producing the Beechjet 400A light business jet on a 
common assembly line with its specially missionized military derivative, the
U.S. Air Force T-1A Jayhawk trainer. This is good for the U.S. Air Force
and good for Raytheon. Since the initial contract award in 1990, the
U.S. Air Force has ordered a total of 148 trainers with a value of $628 million.
The total U.S. program potential is 180 aircraft.

A VISION FOR THE FUTURE

In the pages that follow, we welcome you to take a closer look at Raytheon -~
at a company in transition. Our vision for the future is a Raytheon that wins
world-class mega-projects in engineering and construction; that builds on its
great reputation in aviation with the Beech and Hawker names; that is even
stronger and more cohesive in appliances; that successfully expands its defense
technology into new and exciting commercial markets; and that continues to be
a strong competitor in defense.
  In February 1994, the Board of Directors expressed its confidence in 
Raytheon by authorizing the repurchase of up to 12 million shares of the
company's common stock.
  Raytheon anticipates record sales, net income, and earnings per share
based on significantly improved operating results in the first quarter 1994. On 
March 9, 1994, the company announced a restructuring charge of $162 million
after tax. Because of our anticipated record quarter, we will still be profitable for
the quarter even after the special charge.
  As we pursue our goals, we will keep integrity and quality Number One.
With these standards, we are secure enough to change with the times. The 
people of Raytheon are fully capable of meeting the challenges ahead -~ and we
know how important it is to go forward as a team. Teamwork is a pillar of our
strength and a springboard for the future.

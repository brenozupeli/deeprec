COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Raytheon Company has prepared the financial statements
and related data contained in this Annual Report. The
company's financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
and reflect judgments and estimates as to the expected 
effects of transactions and events currently being reported.
Raytheon is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of
the financial statements and other financial data included in 
this report. To meet this responsibility, the company main-
tains a system of internal accounting controls to provide 
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that
transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system


includes policies and procedures, internal audits, and
company officers' reviews.
  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is
composed solely of outside directors. The Committee meets
periodically and, when appropriate, separately with represen-
tatives of the independent accountants, company officers, 
and the internal auditors to monitor the activities of each.
  Upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, Coopers 
& Lybrand, independent accountants, have been selected by 
the Board of Directors to audit the company's financial state-
ments and their report follows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Raytheon Company
Lexington, Mass.


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
Raytheon Company and Subsidiaries Consolidated as of Dec.
31, 1993 and 1992, and the related statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended Dec. 31, 1993. These financial state-
ments are the responsibility of the company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assur-
ance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall


financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Raytheon Company and Subsidiaries Consolidated as of
Dec. 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended Dec. 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

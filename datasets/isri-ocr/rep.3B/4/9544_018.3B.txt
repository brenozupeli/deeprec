CPC ~ INTERNATIONAL


CPC supplies customers in 65 industries 
with ingredients for products such as baked
goods, beer, candy, corrugated board, cos-
metics, paper, salad oils, and soft drinks.


of six plants. Quality improve-
ments and a capacity increase


strengthened Corn Products' leading dextrose position in North
America; a line of modified starches serving the corrugating 
industry was strengthened; and the unit successfully reentered
the maltodextrin market.
  In Latin America, where CPC has 13 plants and is the leading
corn refiner, volumes and sales each increased 11%. Operating 
income for the Latin America division improved 14%. The success-
ful 1993 introduction of high maltose corn syrup to the largest
beer maker in Brazil should add significant sales and profits
beginning in 1994.
  The Cooperative Management Group (CMG), which manages 
ventures in 14 countries, including 11 countries in Africa and Asia,
posted a 17% increase in operating income. Profits in Pakistan
and Malaysia hit all-time highs, as operating income grew 58% 
and 56%, respectively. 
  CMG also operates Pekin Energy Company, a joint venture 
with Texaco to produce fuel ethanol. Pekin is the nation's No. 2
producer of ethanol, a clean-burning, high-quality, fermentation-
grade alcohol used as an octane enhancer in gasoline.

STRATEGIC ACTION

  Each operating unit sets its own objectives and tactics compat-
ible with the corn refining business's five key strategies: 1) contin-


uously deliver quality in products and services that
is valued by CPC's customers; 2) continuously


drive for delivered cost leadership; 3) lever-
age and grow leading market positions


and strategic relationships; 4) im-
prove and expand positions in 
higher value-added and differenti-


ated corn refining products; and 5) contin-


uously improve organizational 
effectiveness.


  Ongoing quality programs, such as Total Quality Excellence at
Corn Products in North America, Total Quality in Colombia, and a 
plan called Terra Nova in Brazil, continue to yield improved cus-
tomer satisfaction ratings. Quality-driven performance also earns 
the corn refining business the chance to partner with customers 
on future business opportunities. In Latin America customer sur-
veys were initiated to establish a quality and service benchmark
for future improvement.
  CPC's corn refining business is well positioned to take advan-
tage of the new, more open economies, as trade barriers fall
worldwide and countries change policies to increase cross-bor-
der business. CPC is the only corn refiner with plants in Canada,
Mexico, and the U.S., and the passage of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will allow for more sharing of 
products and technology, more exports, and a more efficient
business.
  In Latin America, where privatization continues at a rapid pace 
and trade pacts are reducing tariffs, affiliates are pooling 
resources to produce more cost-competitive products. Grind of
waxy corn was eliminated in Mexico and Chile because the starch
could be produced and shipped more cheaply from Brazil. The 
Colombian affiliate expanded exports into the Andean Pact
nations of Ecuador and Peru, spurring strong volume growth.

SHARING EXPERTISE

  One of CPC's core strengths is its vast global organization built
from solid local management. Another is its ability to share tech-
nology and expertise across regions and countries. In the corn
refining business, a special unit called the Business Experience 
Transfer Group evaluates processes and systems, sharing the best 
and most successful of these with the rest of the corn refining

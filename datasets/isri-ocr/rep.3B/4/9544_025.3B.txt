1993 ~ ANNUAL REPORT


he preceding pages of
this report tell the CPC 


story in terms of brands, businesses, and financial 
measurements. They depict a leading and steadily
growing food Company with operations in 58 coun-
tries of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia,


the Mideast, and Africa, and a portfolio of some of the most well-
known and valued food brands in the world.
  There is, however, another equally important CPC story. It con-
cerns the framework on which we build our businesses -~ our 
basic values and objectives -~ and how this framework defines 
the way we do business and interact with our communities in our
dozens of markets.
  This story begins with the CPC Company Policies Manual
and its sections on CPC Conduct, Business Ethics, Community
Relations, Compliance with Antitrust Laws, Customer and 
Consumer Relations, Disclosure and Insider Trading, Employee
Relations, and Protection of the Environment. Published in 13
languages, the Policies Manual is distributed to employees
throughout the world.
  In his introduction to the Policies Manual, CPC Chairman
Dick Shoemate says: "Our primary mission -~ to maximize the 
financial return to our stockholders -~ is not in any way incon-
sistent with the observance of high moral and ethical standards.
To the contrary, I believe we cannot succeed without such stan-
dards. We must actively aspire to the kind of corporate conduct
and achievement that will make us and our successors proud to
be CPC employees and will give us a competitive advantage in 
the long run."


Representative examples of "The CPC
Way" can be found in many areas.


Environmental Protection:Like the other policies in the manual,
CPC's policy on protection of the environment is overseen by top
management and the Board's Corporate Affairs Committee and is
communicated comprehensively throughout the Company. This
policy states that CPC is committed to satisfying all applicable 
legislative and regulatory requirements or even higher, self-
imposed, standards, and that CPC will prevent or correct conditions
that pose a threat to the environment. 
  The great majority of CPC's facilities are consumer foods pro-
cessing plants and as such present relatively few serious environ-
mental risks. Thus environmental efforts in our consumer foods
business typically focus on improvements rather than corrections
-~ for example reductions in packaging materials, recycling 
programs and the use of recycled materials, and increased 
energy efficiency.
  In corn refining the challenges are greater. Environmental
efforts at CPC's Argo, Illinois, corn refining plant illustrate our
commitment to meeting them. Compliance with new regulations,
modernization of the plant, and CPC initiatives have resulted in: a
70% reduction in air pollutant emissions since 1976; a substantial
reduction in wastewater volume generated by the plant, coupled 
with a 30% reduction in biodegradable organic discharges since 
1980; a reduction in the volume of packaging material; and 
expansion of a plant-wide recycling program. The rebuild of a 
corn oil extraction facility, to be completed in 1994, will cut odor
emissions, and atmospheric emissions of volatile organic material
from corn germ processing will be reduced by more than 40%.

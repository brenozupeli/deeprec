Leadership. . . The highest compliment you could
give GE managers a few years ago was to say they were "on
top of things" or had gotten "their arms around them."  These
techniques, more useful in tackling people than coaching
them, are difficult to get rid of.


Some have argued that single-product busi-
nesses have a focus that gives them an advantage
over multibusiness companies like our own -~
and perhaps they would have, but only if we ne-
glect our own overriding advantage:  the ability
to share the ideas that are the result of wide and
rich input from a multitude of global sources.

GE businesses share technology, design,
compensation and personnel evaluation systems,
manufacturing practices, and customer and
country knowledge.  Gas Turbines shares manu-
facturing technology with Aircraft Engines;
Motors and Transportation Systems work
together on new locomotive propulsion systems;
Lighting and Medical Systems collaborate to
improve x-ray tube processes; and GE Capital 
provides innovative financing packages that help
all our businesses around the globe.  These are
just a few of the thousands of examples of how
our businesses work together.  Supporting all this
is a management system that fosters and rewards
this sharing and teamwork, and, increasingly, a


culture that makes it reflexive and natural at
every level and corner of our Company.

When we began our pursuit of boundaryless-
ness, we believed that the boundaries just de-
scribed -~ the walls, if you will -~ would be the 
most difficult to eliminate, while the hierarchical
management layers would be the easiest because 
they could simply be taken out by directive.  The
big, visible layers at the top of the Company -~
Sectors, Groups and the like -~ were easy to get
rid of, but deeper within the businesses, the
layers -~ formal and informal -~ are not only
hard to remove, they are often hard to find.  The
compulsion to manage, to control, to direct, is a
powerful one, reinforced by a century-old tradi-
tion at GE of measuring one's self-worth by how
many people "work for you" and whether or not
the word "manager" appears in your title.  The
highest compliment you could give GE managers
a few years ago was to say they were "on top of
things" or had gotten "their arms around them."
These techniques, more useful in tackling people
than coaching them, are difficult to get rid of.

What we are looking for today at GE are lead-
ers at every level who can energize, excite and
coach rather than enervate, depress and control.
And never has this atmosphere been more criti-
cal.  Today, everyone must be engaged if we are to 
win.  The kind of people we need in this Company
are those unwilling to "put in their time" in the
bowels of the bureaucracy, or grunt along under
the heel of some autocrat for years, before they get
a chance to make decisions, try something and
be rewarded in their souls as well as their wallets.

In some difficult cases this means parting
company with some impressive people -~ Heis-
man Trophy candidates, to use an American
football expression -~ who won't block for others
or play as part of a team.  Their debilitating effect
on the team can outweigh the benefits of their
individual talent.  Leaders at GE are now sub-
ject to what we call a 360~ evaluation, meaning
they are rated not just by those above them, but
by their peers and their subordinates as well.
This has become a powerful tool for detecting
and changing those who "smile up and kick
down."  To be blunt, the two quickest ways to
part company with GE are, one, to commit an
integrity violation, or, two, to be a controlling,


Work-Out, the GE process for empowering employees and
breaking boundaries, is generating ideas in offices and on
factory floors.  Here at Appliance Park in Louisville, Ky., for
example, employees like utility operator Leo Porter (left)
and shop steward Ron Rowe of IUE Local 761 are constant-
ly coming up with ideas -~ and putting them into action -~
to "Save the Park."

  See note 8 for further information on GECS' allowance
for losses on financing receivables.

Cash equivalents. Marketable securities with original matu-
rities of three months or less are included in cash equiva-
lents unless held for trading or investment.

Investment and trading securities. On December 31, 1993,
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Invest-
ments in Debt and Equity Securities, which requires that invest-
ments in debt securities and marketable equity securities
be designated as trading, held-to-maturity or available-
for-sale.  Trading securities are reported at fair value, with
changes in fair value included in earnings.  Investment se-
curities include both available-for-sale and held-to-matu-
rity securities.  Available-for-sale securities are reported at
fair value, with net unrealized gains and losses that would
be available to share owners included in equity.  Held-to-
maturity debt securities are reported at amortized cost.
See notes 10 and 11 for a discussion of the classification
and reporting of these securities at December 31, 1992.
For all investment securities, unrealized losses that are
other than temporary are recognized in earnings.

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase
agreements) and securities purchased under agreements to resell
(reverse repurchase agreements).  Repurchase and reverse re-
purchase agreements are entered into by Kidder, Peabody
and treated as financing transactions, carried at the con-
tract amount at which the securities subsequently will be
resold or reacquired.  Repurchase agreements relate either
to marketable securities, which are carried at market val-
ue, or to securities obtained pursuant to reverse repur-
chase agreements.  It is Kidder, Peabody's policy to take
possession of securities subject to reverse repurchase
agreements, to monitor the market value of the underly-
ing securities in relation to the related receivable, includ-
ing accrued interest, and to obtain additional collateral
when appropriate.

Inventories.  Virtually all of GE's U.S. inventories are stated
on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis; other inventories are
primarily stated on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  None
of the inventories exceed realizable values.

Intangible assets.  Goodwill is amortized over its estimated
period of benefit and other intangible assets over their esti-
mated lives.  The amortization period does not exceed 40
years, and amortization is generally on a straight-line basis.
Goodwill in excess of associated expected operating cash
flows is considered to be impaired and is written down to
fair value.

Deferred insurance acquisition costs.  For the property and
casualty business, deferred insurance acquisition costs are
amortized pro rata over the contract periods in which the
related premiums are earned.  For the life insurance busi-
ness, these costs are amortized over the premium-paying


periods of the contracts in proportion either to anticipated
premium income or to gross profit, as appropriate.  For cer-
tain annuity contracts, such costs are amortized on the ba-
sis of anticipated gross profits.  For other lines of business,
acquisition costs are amortized over the life of the related
insurance contracts.  Deferred insurance acquisition costs
are reviewed for recoverability; for short-duration con-
tracts, anticipated investment income is considered in
making recoverability evaluations.

Note 2 Discontinued Operations

On April 2, 1993, General Electric Company transferred
GE's Aerospace business segment, GE Government
Services, Inc., and an operating component of GE that
operated Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory under a
contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to a new
company controlled by the shareholders of Martin
Marietta Corporation in a transaction valued at $3.3
billion.  The transfer resulted in a gain of $678 million
after taxes of $752 million.  Net assets of discontinued
operations at December 31, 1992, have been segregated in
the Statement of Financial Position. Summary operating
results of discontinued operations, excluding the above
gain, are as follows.

GECS Allowance for Losses on Financing
Receivables


GECS allowance for losses on financing receivables repre-
sented 2.63% of total financing receivables at year-end
1993 and 1992.  The allowance for small-balance receiv-
ables is determined principally on the basis of actual ex-
perience during the preceding three years.  Further allow-
ances are provided to reflect management's judgment of
additional loss potential.  For other receivables, principally
the larger loans and leases, the allowance for losses is de-
termined primarily on the basis of management's judg-
ment of net loss potential, including specific allowances
for known troubled accounts.  The table below shows the ac-
tivity in the allowance for losses on financing receivables
during each of the past three years.

Balance at January 1          $ 1,607   $ 1,508   $ 1,360
Provisions charged to

  companies acquired or sold      126        52       135

Balance at December 31        $ 1,730   $ 1,607   $ 1,508


  All accounts or portions thereof deemed to be uncollec-
tible or to require an excessive collection cost are written
off to the allowance for losses.  Small-balance accounts are
progressively written down (from 10% when more than
three months delinquent to 100% when 9-12 months
delinquent) to record the balances at estimated realizable
value.  If at any time during that period an account is
judged to be uncollectible, such as in the case of a bank-
ruptcy, the uncollectible balance is written off.  Large-
balance accounts are reviewed at least quarterly, and those
accounts that are more than three months delinquent are
written down, if necessary, to record the balances at esti-
mated realizable value.  Amounts written off in 1993 were
approximately 1.46% of average financing receivables
outstanding during the year, compared with 1.58% and
1.87% of average financing receivables outstanding dur-
ing 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Modest growth in paper-grade pulp demand is expected during 1994. >  At the same time, little new
chemical pulp capacity is expected to start up in 1994.  A large part of the capacity that will start up
in the next few years will be hardwood from the Southern Hemisphere.  Current weak earnings, environ-
mental expenditures required on existing facilities, and increasing environmental regulation related
to the construction of new mills should constrain future capacity growth. > Weyerhaeuser's
major mill modernizations, announced last year, will put the company in a strong competitive position
in terms of product and process quality and the environmental status of our mill system.  Parts of the
Plymouth, N.C., modernization are scheduled to start up during 1994, including the rebuilt No. 4

capabilities, while lowering costs.  Also part of the Plymouth project is a rebuild of the No. 1 linerboard

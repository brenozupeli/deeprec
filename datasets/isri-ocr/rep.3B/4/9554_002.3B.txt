94 Exceeding Customer Expectations


To Our Shareholders,
I am pleased to report that we achieved record sales and
net income for 1994. Revenues increased 11 percent, making 
1994 the 48th consecutive year of higher sales. The 20 percent
increase in net income reflects double-digit profit improvements
by all four business groups.

I am also pleased that we were able to sustain our record of
increased dividends. 1994 was the 19th consecutive year of
increases, and the dividend totalled $1.44 a share.

In each of the past several years we have highlighted one 
of our corporate objectives in our annual report to you. This 
year we focus on growth which we consider a measure of our
success in exceeding customer expectations. We believe that 
if we deliver even more than what our customers expect, our
customers will return again and again, asking Johnson Controls
to do more, and contribute more, to their success.

EXCEEDING 
EXPECTATIONS

In 1994 we got some help from a strong domestic economy,
but most of our growth came from providing our existing
customers with new ways to improve their business perfor-
mance. In all four of our businesses, we are doing more for
customers than we did just a few years ago. As our customers
outsource functions they used to perform themselves, new
opportunities open for Johnson Controls.

In our controls business, for example, building owners are
asking us to take complete responsibility for operating and 
maintaining their buildings, in addition to providing them
with building control systems. As a result, Johnson Controls
people are in these facilities every day, providing services to
ensure a total quality building environment. Achieving growth
principally through our existing customers is a direction we 
have chosen for all our businesses.

Throughout Johnson Controls, growth increasingly means
taking total systems responsibility and making the scope of
our capabilities broader than ever before. In our automotive 
business, we are starting to do much more than assemble


seats or manufacture seat components. We have begun to
take responsibility for designing new, advanced complete seat
systems like our Integrated Belt-In-Seat System, and compo-
nents such as power track mechanisms. Our customers are
increasingly looking to us to help them define what consumers
consider quality seating.

Another direction for our company involves global leadership,
that is, leveraging our strong relationships with existing 
customers so that as they expand around the world, they take
Johnson Controls with them. As we establish world-class
competencies we are given the opportunity to provide these
services in dozens of countries across the globe. Following 
successes in North America, for example, our high-heat han-
dling plastic bottles are finding additional growth in European
markets for beverages such as iced tea and sports drinks.


We believe that if we deliver even more
than what our customers expect, our
customers will return again and again, 
asking Johnson Controls to do more,
and contribute more, to their success.


While our company becomes involved in new technologies, 
new services and new areas of the world, we cannot lose sight
of the fundamental component of our drive to exceed customer 
expectations: continuous improvements in quality, service,
productivity and time compression. For example, to under-
score our belief that we deliver superior quality in automotive
batteries, in 1994 we introduced a manufacturer's warranty
substantially longer than any other in the industry. Our cus-
tomers are already crediting increased growth to this feature.

On the following pages, you'll find many other examples of 
the ways Johnson Controls is growing by striving to continu-
ally exceed our customers' increasing expectations.

I would like to express my appreciation to Ettore Barbatelli,
Sr. and William L. Rootham, two members of the Board of 
Directors who retired in 1994. Ettore Barbatelli served on the 
Board since 1973. Bill Rootham joined Johnson Controls in
1949, served as Vice Chairman, and helped strengthen the

NORTH AMERICA  9


NORTH AMERICA.  Nineteen ninety-four was an anomaly in today's North American home-appliance industry, a
year in which shipments of new products jumped by about 11 percent to record levels.  For the longer term, ours is an
industry of slower growth, though the three-percent increase expected for 1995 will produce another record year.
  Our strategy within the North American Appliance Group (NAAG) is to profitably take larger pieces of that pie
each year, regardless of where our industry is in its cycle.
  Since 1992, our attention has been intensely directed at understanding the latent needs of the people who buy
our products, then using that knowledge to deliver on our brand promises and, finally, create a dominant consumer
franchise, or "DCF," in home appliances.  A DCF exists when consumers insist on our brands for reasons other than
price, when they view our products as clearly superior to other appliances, when they demonstrate strong loyalty in
their future purchase decisions.
  Last year, that approach to producing and marketing home appliances in North America resulted in sharp
increases in revenues and operating profit.  The solid performance wasn't limited to the U.S.: Inglis, Ltd., our wholly
owned Canadian subsidiary, and Vitromatic S.A., Whirlpool's Mexican affiliate, also had very strong years.  Inglis
solidified its position as Canada's largest appliance company with further market share gains, while Vitromatic
significantly improved its cost structure and contributed substantially to North American profitability.
  The DCF strategy is a fundamentally different way for us to do business.  We've always been very good at
reducing costs and improving product quality, and still are, but changing the very rules of competition in our industry
requires more.  It requires products that are consistently more functional and attractive, superior service and constant
innovation in all aspects of our system so that many consumers choose to replace their appliances with our products
even before they eventually fail.  As part of the strategy, we're continuing to refine the positioning of our major brands
to serve all consumers effectively:  KitchenAid, style and substance; Whirlpool, products which help you run your home;
and Roper, a quality value brand.

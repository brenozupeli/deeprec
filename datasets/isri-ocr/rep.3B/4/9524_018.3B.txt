focus, the operation produced little manufacturing waste.
  As the pads were being manufactured, 3M marketers continued
their research, which showed that consumers preferred the Never Rust
soap pad by more than two to one compared with steel wool.  At the
same time, marketers refined their plans for packaging, distribution
and sales support.  Four-, eight- and 14-count packages would be
available through grocery stores, mass merchandisers, convenience
stores, hardware stores, drug stores and membership-club stores. In
another environmentally sensitive move, the soap pad's eye-catching
boxes were made from 100 percent recycled paper.
  To support the launch, 3M drew distributors into the effort, soliciting
input on displays and promotions.  Television advertising, newspaper
inserts, coupons, free samples and an extensive public relations effort
were also developed to increase consumer awareness and promote sales.
  3M's strategic objective of increasing market penetration outside
the United States meant that Never Rust soap pads were destined to
travel.  The international marketing plan, developed simultaneously
with the U.S. plan, had a twofold objective: capture share in markets
such as Brazil, where steel wool pads have a large consumer base, and
attract new consumers in places such as Japan, where steel wool is not
commonly used.  Never Rust pads were introduced simultaneously in
the United States, Canada, Colombia and New Zealand, then in other
countries in Latin America and the Far East.  Tracking studies show
that Never Rust pads have successfully attracted new buyers to the


product category, while strong demand for other Scotch-Brite prod-
ucts has been maintained.
  After one of the most successful product launches in 3M history,
the Never Rust team didn't rest on its laurels.  Following a typical 3M
pattern, they continued their work on parallel tracks: streamlining
production to improve efficiency and initiating development of the
product's next generation.
  In January 1994, 3M introduced Scotch-BriteTM Never ScratchTM
Wool Soap Pads.  Addressing another limitation of steel wool, Never
Scratch pads provide effective cleaning power for nonstick cookware,
china and other delicate surfaces.  Additional products based on this
technology are under development.
  Meanwhile, the technology breakthrough in the Never Rust pad
has already found application in other 3M product lines.  For example,
Never Rust commercial floor polisher pads, also made from recycled
plastic, offer a better way to clean marble floors.

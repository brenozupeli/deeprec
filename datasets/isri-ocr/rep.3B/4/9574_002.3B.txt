2 CHAIRMAN'S LETTER


~ TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS:  It's been more than six years since
Whirlpool Corporation began to execute a strategy to create consistent,
long-term shareholder value by remaking itself from essentially a U.S.
appliance maker and marketer into the leader in an emerging global home-
appliance industry.
  Along the way, two objectives have commanded much of our
attention: first, producing strong, short-term results even as we invest
heavily in the company's future; second, building competitive advantage by
continuing to integrate our expanding worldwide enterprise at all levels, and
to leverage its best practices and Whirlpool's cumulative size.
  Again in 1994, we delivered on both counts.
  Revenues for the year reached a record $8.10 billion, eight percent
better than the previous high of $7.53 billion in 1993.  Reported net earnings
totaled $158 million, versus $51 million one year ago, though the totals for
both years were affected by significant one-time gains and losses.
  Our robust, record operating performance becomes clear when you
exclude those items from the year-over-year comparison: 1994 earnings of
$332 million, or $4.40 per share, 17 percent better than $285 million, or
$3.94 per share, in '93.
  Individually, all of our regional businesses-~in North America,
Europe, Latin America and Asia-~increased product shipments and market

STRENGTHENING ESTABLISHED COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES


ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION

CONSOLIDATED AND REORGANIZED 

The Energy and Environmental segment expanded and reorganized in 1993 to 
create an integrated, world-class organization called Raytheon Engineers &
Constructors International. Major acquisitions extended the organization's 
depth in infrastructure and transportation, fossil power, nuclear power, and
construction -~ and added a presence in the Far East. The reorganization 
combined Raytheon's United Engineers & Constructors, Badger, Raytheon
Service Company, and Cedarapids units into one functional organization,
forming one of the largest engineering and construction groups in the world.
It offers a single source for program management, engineering, fabrication,
construction, and operations and maintenance. It operates in 11 business
sectors: power, nuclear, petroleum and gas, polymers and chemicals, pharma-
ceuticals and biotechnology, infrastructure and transportation, metals and 
mining, food and consumer products, environmental services, government
services, and heavy equipment and fabrication.

KEY ACQUISITIONS

Three acquisitions were made to strengthen the group in 1993. The largest 
acquisition, completed in December, was the purchase of power,
infrastructure, quality management, and construction assets of Ebasco
Services, Inc., from ENSERCH Corp., for $210 million. Earlier, selected assets
of Harbert Construction Company of Birmingham, Ala., were acquired, 
further strengthening Raytheon's capabilities in design and construction of
commercial buildings, light industrial facilities, and highways. Also acquired
during the year were selected assets of Gibbs & Hill, with expertise in 
transportation, communications, signals, infrastructure and fossil power
projects, and participation in the successful Taiwan-based Gibsin Engineers.

MAJOR REFINERY WIN

Raytheon broadened its strength in the fast-growing Asian market during the 
year. Near year-end, a Raytheon Engineers & Constructors joint venture with
Fluor Daniel was awarded a major lump-sum project valued at more than
$1.3 billion to provide engineering, design, procurement, and construction for
a new oil refinery in Thailand for Rayong Refinery Company. In addition, a 
contract was received for a new ethylbenzene/styrene plant in Guangzhou for
the China Petrochemical International Company.
  In the United States, a fixed-price contract valued at more than
$60 million was received to complete engineering, equipment procurement,
and construction of the Lost Cabin sour gas processing plant in Wyoming for
The Louisiana Land & Exploration Company.


~ Raytheon Engineers & Constructors provided 
engineering and procurement for Exxon Company's 
recently completed gas treating plant at Mobile
Bay, Alabama. The facility processes sour gas and 
liquids from an offshore platform complex to 
produce gas, sulfur, and other recoverable products.

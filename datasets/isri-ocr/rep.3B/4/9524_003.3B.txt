"In all our businesses, we're
focusing on products that create
a new basis of competition.
Recent examples range from
patented soap pads that don't 
rust or splinter to replacements
for ozone-depleting chemicals."


They're larger than the U.S. economy, and our penetration of these
economies is significantly lower.
  During the year, we continued our strong growth in the Asia Pacific
area and in Latin America.  Sales volume of our 12 companies in Asia
outside Japan grew about 40 percent.  In Latin America, unit volume
grew more than 20 percent.
  In Europe, we completed the transition from country-focused organiza-
tions to business-centered units.  This new way of operating is speeding up
decision-making, increasing efficiency and sharpening our customer focus.
  We also formed an organization to capitalize on growth opportunities
in Eastern Europe, the Mideast and Central Asia -~ an area encompassing
more than 40 countries and 750 million people.

~ Customer Satisfaction
We want customers to prefer 3M by a wide margin over our competitors.
This means being the best not only in product quality and value, but in
everything we do -~ from ease of ordering to accuracy of deliveries.
  During the year, we continued to make major investments in customer-
friendly systems for order entry, distribution and invoicing.

~ Productivity Improvement
To meet our financial goals and stay competitive, we're putting strong
emphasis on productivity improvement.  This means:
  ~ Getting the most out of every R&D dollar we spend.
  ~ Lowering manufacturing costs through reductions in cycle time,
waste and energy usage.
  ~ Maintaining tight control of capital spending.
  ~ Improving marketing efficiency.
  ~ Streamlining organizational structure.
  ~ Eliminating activities that don't add value for customers.
  During the year, our 6 percent volume gain was accomplished with
about 1,125 fewer people.  We have now reduced employment, largely
through attrition, by about 3,650 on a comparable basis over the last
three years.  This has been done while maintaining strong employee
commitment and motivation.

~ Outlook for 1994
Many economists expect a pickup in global economic growth, espe-
cially in the second half of the year.  A stronger economy, combined
with a steady stream of new products and ongoing efforts to improve
productivity, will help our results.  However, the pricing environment
is likely to remain quite competitive and currency fluctuations could
have a significant, negative effect on our results again this year.
  Given all of this, we look for a reasonable increase in 1994 earnings,
along with a continued strong financial position.

Operating revenues for 1993 were $25.4 billion compared
to $30.2 billion and $29.3 billion for 1992 and 1991.
Commercial aircraft products and services accounted for
81%, 80% and 78% of total operating revenues for the
years 1993, 1992 and 1991. The Company's commercial
jet transport market share was approximately 60% in terms
of sales value for each of the three years.

 Commercial production rates were at 32~~~ aircraft per
month at the beginning of 1993 and ended the year at 23
per month. In early 1994, the 747 production rate was
reduced from 5 to 3 per month. Based on current produc-
tion schedules, the 737 rate will be reduced from 10 to 8~~~
per month in the fourth quarter of 1994, the 757 rate will
be reduced from 5 to 4 per month in the first quarter of
1995, the 767 rate will be increased from 3 to 4 per month
in the first quarter of 1995, and the 747 rate will be re-
duced from 3 to 2 per month in January 1995. Planned
production rates will continue to be adjusted as necessary
to match customer orders. Production of the new 777
model is on schedule to support the flight test program
starting in mid-1994, and production activity will continue
to build until initial deliveries begin in mid-1995. Com-
mercial jet transport deliveries for 1994 are currently
projected to be in the 260 range. Commercial transporta-
tion sales trends are discussed further in the Commercial
Aircraft Market Environment section on pages 29-32.

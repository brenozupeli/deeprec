CPC ~ INTERNATIONAL


  Also in 1993, CPC reviewed usage of chemical materials at its
plants worldwide, and, wherever possible, is substituting safer
materials and technologies for those posing the greatest risks.
  Environmental clean-up programs at the sites of several chem-
ical companies divested by CPC in the 1970s and 1980s are pro-
gressing in cooperation with federal and state authorities.
  On environmental or any other matters affecting our commu-
nities, CPC encourages its managers to maintain frank and fre-
quent communication with local citizens and officials.
Employee Development and Opportunity: CPC believes that 
the profitable growth of its businesses depends vitally on the 
development and effective deployment of the full range of our 
employees' abilities, and on strong mutual commitment between
CPC and its employees. Thus our goal in each of our 58 countries,
and for each of our approximately 39,000 employees, is to hire
wisely, train thoroughly, compensate fairly, and provide challeng-
ing career development opportunities -~ all within safe and 
healthy working environments. CPC continued its emphasis on
management and leadership development in 1993. Through
formal and informal programs and methods, CPC seeks to develop
and motivate managers who not only deliver results locally but
also participate in an active international network to help build
business worldwide.
  The Company is committed to the principles of equal employ-
ment opportunity and fair employment practices. Thirty-five per-


cent of CPC's nearly 8,000 U.S. employees are minorities and 30% 
are women. In recent years, and in 1993 especially, CPC has pro-
moted valuing differences in our employee population through
training programs and other experiences. The Company has sev-
eral programs to further the hiring and upward mobility of 
women and minorities, including four-year internship programs
for talented minority students.
Contributions: Financial and other support for our communities'
institutions and activities is an essential part of "The CPC Way." In 
1993, the Company made contributions valued at approximately 
$20 million in cash and food products, mainly to educational insti-
tutions; health, welfare, and community service organizations; and 
other cultural and charitable groups. A significant part of CPC's 
contributions is donated through CPC's Matching Gifts Program in
the U.S., which matches $2 for every $1 employees contribute. To
this financial support are added the volunteer and Company-spon-
sored service activities of employees at many of our facilities, often
in connection with local schools and educational projects.
Commitment to the Consumer: CPC is committed to marketing 
only the highest quality products at prices that truly reflect value.
We constantly strive to meet and anticipate consumers' prefer-
ences regarding health, taste, and convenience. CPC regularly
disseminates information to consumers, stressing the importance
of the total dietary approach to good health and physical fitness.

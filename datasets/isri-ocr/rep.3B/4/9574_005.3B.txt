CHAIRMAN'S LETTER  5


eventually lead, throughout the Asian region.  That market is the industry's largest, fastest growing and, within 10
years, will likely consume about as many home appliances each year as North America and Western Europe combined.
  During 1994, we acquired controlling interest in our eight-year-old Indian washer joint venture and agreed to
purchase a majority position in that country's largest manufacturer and marketer of refrigerators.  We entered into or
began negotiations regarding joint ventures with three excellent Chinese companies to make and sell all of Asia's four
major products-~refrigerators, microwave ovens, washers and air conditioners-~in the most populous country on
earth.  Eventually, those operations will export products to other countries in Asia and elsewhere.


  We also opened additional offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in China, and realigned
our Asian operations into four subregions to most effectively carry out activities there.  Whirlpool now
has a marketing presence in 12 Asian countries.  This year, we believe we will become the second-largest
appliance company in this rapidly evolving and fragmented region, excluding Japan.
  The greatest challenge for us in 1995 and years ahead is to further integrate our new and
existing businesses wherever possible and appropriate, sharing physical capabilities, knowledge,
systems and processes so that we can most effectively design products and services which delight
consumers around the globe.  After all, an intense focus on satisfying our current and future customers


is what succeeding in this business is all about.
  We think that consistent shareholder value is built upon a foundation rooted in
successfully meeting specific internal goals for customer satisfaction, productivity, quality and
development of our people.  The most critical of those three elements is the need to enhance the
skills of and opportunities for our 39,000 men and women.  To help develop global leaders, we
opened a new management training and education center near our Benton Harbor

Note 13 (continued)


  In January 1991, the Company received from the U.S.
Government a notice of partial termination for default
which terminated most of the work required under con-
tracts to develop and install a new air defense system for
Saudi Arabia, known as the Peace Shield program.  The
Government has filed with the Company a demand for
repayment of $605 of Peace Shield unliquidated progress
payments plus interest commencing January 25, 1991. In
February 1991, the Company submitted a request for a
deferred payment agreement which, if granted, would
formally defer the Company's potential obligation to repay
the $605 of unliquidated progress payments until the
conclusion of the appeal process.  In June 1991, the Gov-
ernment selected another contractor to perform the work
which is the subject of the contracts that have been termi-
nated for default, and the Government will likely assert
claims related to the reprocurement.  The Company does
not expect the Government to assert such claims prior to
completion of the reprocurement contract, which was
originally scheduled for late 1995.
  Management's position, supported by outside legal
counsel which specializes in government procurement law,
is that the grounds for default asserted by the Government
in the Peace Shield termination are not legally support-
able.  Accordingly, management and counsel are of the
opinion that on appeal the termination for default has a
substantial probability of being converted to termination
for the convenience of the Government, which would
eliminate any Government claim for cost of reprocurement
or other damages.  Additionally, the Company has a legal
basis for a claim for equitable adjustment to the prices and
schedules of the contracts (the "Contract Claim").  Many
of the same facts underlie both the Contract Claim and
the Company's appeal of the Government's termination
action.  The Company has filed its complaint in the United
States Claims Court to overturn the default termination in
order to obtain payment of the Contract Claim.  The parties


are currently litigating jurisdictional issues related to the
complaint, and are engaged in discovery.  Trial is currently
scheduled for March 1997.  The Company expects that its
position will ultimately be upheld with respect to the
termination action and that it will prevail on the Contract
Claim.

  The Company's financial statements have been pre-
pared on the basis of a conservative estimate of the revised
values of the Peace Shield contracts including the Contract
Claim and the Company's position that the termination
was for the convenience of the Government.  At this time,
the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length of 
time that will be required to resolve the termination appeal
and the Contract Claim.  In the event that the Company's
appeal of the termination for default is not successful, the
Company could realize a pre-tax loss on the program
approximating the value of the unliquidated progress
payments plus related interest and potential damages
assessed by the Government.

  The Company is subject to several U.S. Government
investigations of business and cost classification practices.
One investigation involves a grand jury proceeding as to
whether or not certain costs were charged to the proper
overhead accounts.  No charges have been filed in this
matter, and based on the facts known to it, the Company
believes it would have defenses if any were filed.  The
investigations could result in civil, criminal or administra-
tive proceedings.  Such proceedings, if any, could involve
claims by the Government for fines, penalties, compensa-
tory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures.
Based upon Government procurement regulations, a
contractor, or one or more of its operating divisions or
subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from
Government contracts if proceedings result from the
investigations.  The Company believes, based upon all
available information, that the outcome of Government
investigations will not have a materially adverse effect on
its financial position or results of operations.

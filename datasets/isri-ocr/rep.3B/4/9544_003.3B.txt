1993 ~ ANNUAL REPORT


STRENGTH 
Through
POSITIONING


  This annual report focuses on the strengths CPC gains through its
  excellent positioning -~ the positioning of its highly-focused businesses
  and products as market leaders; its solid financial positioning; its
geographic positioning on five continents and in the highest-potential
economies in the world; and its positioning as supplier of choice with a growing
number of customers. Our strategy is to leverage these "positioning advantages"
to strengthen market leadership, invest in new and existing ventures, thrive in
markets where opportunities are greatest, and forge lasting customer
partnerships, thus assuring CPC a consistent position among the top performers
in the food industry. In the business reviews and essays that follow, as well as in
the Company's financial statements, we document in detail the progress CPC is
making toward this objective.

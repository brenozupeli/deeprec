is now on the upswing -~ especially after we
reported a profit for the fourth quarter.

 ~ To get closer to customers. Throughout the
summer, the 37 senior executives listed on the 
last page of this annual report spent a great deal of
time talking with our customers. So did the people
who report to them. We talked about everything
-~ where we were good, where we weren't -~ and
we learned a lot. I want everyone in IBM to be
obsessed with satisfying our customers. IBM had 
the reputation of being arrogant. That was probably
true at some point in the past, but it's not going
to happen on my watch.


~ To begin 
setting the important 
strategic directions
IBM will take in the
years ahead.

 I caused quite a 
flap in the press in
July when, at a press
conference, I said,
"The last thing IBM
needs right now is a 
vision." A lot of the
reports forgot the


words "right now" and clucked about where IBM 
was headed without a vision.

 The fact is, no company is going to succeed
without a clear set of tough-minded strategies


grounded in a clear understanding of what's hap-
pening in the marketplace. Some call it mission.
Some call it vision. I call it strategy.

 And strategy is particularly important for IBM
because our industry is going through a period 
of fundamental change at breakneck speed. So are
our customers.

 Thirty years ago, customers looked to IBM as
the experts in information technology. Our products 
may have been proprietary, but we knew how to 
put the pieces together and showed customers what
to do. They could count on us for total solutions.

 Then, in the early '80s, new technologies 
gave birth to PCs, workstations, local area networks
and shrink-wrapped software. Suddenly, you could 
buy computers at the mall or over the phone. And
our traditional large-company customers started
buying products from different suppliers and inte-
grating the pieces themselves. They had more 
options, but they also had a smorgasbord of
incompatible hardware and software.

 Which brings us to today. Customers, bom-
barded by new products every few months, jarred by
the increasing cost and complexity of distributed,
decentralized computing, question the value of a 
constant cacophony of new technology. They're
saying, "Don't just send me faster boxes. Make me 
more efficient. Help me apply information technol-
ogy in ways that achieve competitive advantage."

	Under the long-term credit facility indicated in Note 7, at
May 29, 1994, the Company may borrow up to $500 million
through October 14, 1998.
	The subordinated notes of Geldermann, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary, are placed with banks and are subordi-
nated to the claims of present and future general creditors.
The loans mature on July 31, 1995, and bear interest on a
floating rate basis (7.313% at May 29, 1994).  This is at a
premium over the one-month LIBOR rate.  The loan agree-
ments stipulate that these loans cannot be repaid if such
repayment would cause Geldermann, Inc. not to meet its
regulatory capital requirements.  The Company does not
guarantee Geldermann, Inc. borrowings.
	The most restrictive note agreements (the revolving
credit facilities and certain privately placed long-term debt)
provide that the lenders may require the Company to repay
the debt if (based on terms as defined in the agreements)
Consolidated Funded Debt exceeds 60% of Consolidated
Capital Base or if Fixed Charges coverage is less than 1.75
to 1.0.
	Net interest expense consists of:


					1994		1993		1992

	Included above is short-term interest expense of financial

in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
	Short-term debt interest expense of $12.7 million, $14.6

charged to cost of goods sold.
	Net interest paid was $242.1 million, $239.3 million and
$269.7 million in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
	The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current
installments) was $2,327.5 million as of May 29, 1994.
Based on current market rates primarily provided by outside
investment bankers, the fair value of this debt was estimated
at $2,431.3 million.  The Company's long-term debt is gener-
ally not callable until maturity.

9.  OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES

	Other noncurrent liabilities consist of estimated liabilities
of Beatrice Company (acquired in fiscal 1991), estimated
postretirement health care and pension benefits, and deferred
income tax credits, as follows:


							1994		1993

Income taxes and interest thereon~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$  519.2		$  532.0

	In fiscal 1992 and 1993, the Company made cash pay-
ments to the Internal Revenue Service relating to certain
of the disputed income tax liabilities of the Beatrice
Companies.  These cash payments, which aggregated
$139 million in fiscal 1993 and $150 million in fiscal
1992, are recoverable to the extent that the Company is
successful in resolving the disputed issues for an amount
less than paid (see Note 16).  The payments were made to
mitigate future interest expense associated with the dis-
puted income taxes, and have been netted against the
related noncurrent liabilities.

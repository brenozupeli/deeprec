be read in conjunction with the Review

Financial Statements and related notes.

Results of Operations

Net sales increased 6.6% to $15.5 billion
in 1994, from $14.6 billion in 1993 and
$13.2 billion in 1992.  The increase in
1994 was principally attributable to
business acquisitions and unit volume
growth, offset in part by the weakening
of foreign currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar.  The increase in 1993 resulted
principally from business acquisitions,
net of dispositions, unit volume growth
and the strengthening of foreign cur-
rencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  Exclud-
ing the effects of foreign currencies and
acquisitions and dispositions, sales dollars
increased 3% in 1994 and 5% in 1993.
  The gross profit margin was 37.6%
in 1994, compared with 38.0% in 1993
and 37.3% in 1992.  The decrease in
1994 was attributable to margin declines
in European hosiery and knit products
businesses, offset in part by improved
margins in the Household and Personal
Care and Packaged Meats and Bakery
operations.  The improvement in 1993
was attributable to increased operating
efficiencies resulting from business
restructuring, tighter cost controls
and benefits resulting from capital
expenditures.
  Operating income, which is pretax
earnings before interest and corporate
expenses, decreased 51.6% to $632
million, from $1,307 million in 1993,
while the 1993 operating income
reflected an 8.2% increase over the
$1,207 million in 1992.
  On June 6, 1994, the corporation
announced a restructuring of its world-
wide operations which will result in the
closure of 94 manufacturing and distri-
bution facilities and the severance of
9,900 employees.  This restructuring


reduced 1994 operating income, net
income and primary earnings per share
by $732 million, $495 million and
$1.03, respectively.  The 1994 operating
income includes charges for restructur-
ing as follows:  Personal Products-~
$630 million; Household and Personal
Care-~$55 million; Coffee and
Grocery-~$25 million; and Packaged
Meats and Bakery-~$22 million.
  Of the total pretax charge for
restructuring, $289 million relates to
anticipated losses associated with the
disposal of land, buildings and improve-
ments, and machinery and equipment;
$112 million relates to anticipated expen-
ditures to close and dispose of the idle
facilities; $239 million relates to antici-
pated payments to severed employees;
$33 million relates to the recognition
of pension benefits associated with the
severed employee group; and $59 mil-
lion primarily relates to losses associated
with the disposal of certain businesses.
As of July 2, 1994, no material actions
contemplated in the restructuring plan
have taken place.
  Restructuring actions are expected
to be substantially completed by 1996,
and the corporation expects to fund the
costs of the plan from internal sources
and available borrowing capacity.
  The corporation expects the restruc-
turing plan to begin lowering operating
costs in 1995 and to generate increasing
savings in subsequent years, growing
to an annual savings of approximately
$250 million in 1998.  Savings from
the planned actions will be used for
both business-building initiatives and
profit improvement.
  Excluding the effects of the restruc-
turing charge, acquisitions and fluctua-
tions in foreign exchange rates, operating
income in 1994 was virtually unchanged
from 1993 and increased by approxi-
mately 2% in 1993. In 1994, operating
income in the Packaged Foods segment
increased 2.3% and Packaged Consumer
Products segment decreased 94.5%.


  Excluding the restructuring charge,
operating income in the Packaged Foods
segment increased 10.5% while the
Packaged Consumer Products segment
was virtually unchanged from 1993
results.  The increase in the Packaged
Foods segment is primarily attributable
to higher unit volumes, operating effi-
ciencies, cost controls and business
acquisitions, offset in part by the weak-
ening of foreign currencies relative to
the U.S. dollar. The flat results in the
Packaged Consumer Products segment
were primarily attributable to weak
performances in the European hosiery
and knit products operations and the
weakening of foreign currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar, offset by the impact
of business acquisitions and strong
U.S. knit products and worldwide
intimates results.
  Net interest expense was $145 million
in 1994, compared with $82 million in
1993 and $94 million in 1992. The
increase in 1994 was a result of increased
financing needs for acquisitions and
capital expenditures.  The reduction in
1993 was primarily a result of lower
short-term interest rates and the tempo-
rary refinancing of maturing long-term
debt with short-term notes payable.
  Unallocated corporate expenses are
costs not directly attributable to specific
segment operations.  Unallocated cor-
porate expenses were $98 million in
1994 and $143 million in 1993.  The
reduction in 1994 was primarily attribut-
able to lower administrative expenses
and costs related to hedging foreign
currency movements.  Unallocated cor-
porate expenses, excluding the impact
of unusual items, were $161 million in
1992.  The unusual items recognized in
1992 consisted of a $412 million gain
from the sale of the corporation's over-
the-counter pharmaceutical business,
offset in part by a $190 million provision
primarily related to restructuring
the Packaged Foods segment.  The
restructuring consisted primarily of

Fair Values of Financial Instruments
	The Company believes that the book value of short-term
financial instruments approximates their fair value.  For
these purposes, short-term is defined as any item that
matures, reprices, or represents a cash transaction between
willing parties within six months or less of the measurement
date.  All financial instruments are considered to have a fair
value which approximates book value at May 29, 1994,
unless otherwise specified.

2.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

1994
	At May 30, 1993, the Company had a 50% equity inter-
est in Australia Meat Holdings Pty. Ltd. (AMH), an
Australian beef processor.  Effective the beginning of fiscal
1994, the Company increased its equity interest in AMH to
approximately 91%.  The purchase price of this additional
interest was approximately $61 million.  The accounts of
AMH have been included in the consolidated financial state-
ments since the beginning of fiscal 1994.

1993
	During fiscal 1993, the Company acquired certain busi-
nesses, two of which have been recorded as poolings of
interests, the revenues and net earnings of which did not
significantly affect consolidated results.

1992
	On July 11, 1991, Golden Valley Microwave Foods, Inc.
(Golden Valley) merged with ConAgra through an
exchange of .8514 of a share of ConAgra common stock for
each share of Golden Valley common stock.  Golden Valley
is a leader in the development and marketing of foods
specifically for preparation in microwave ovens.  Products
include popcorn, french fries, breakfast foods and sand-
wiches distributed through vending industry, mass
merchandising outlets and grocery stores.  ConAgra issued
15.0 million shares of common stock for Golden Valley's
18.8 million shares of common stock and assumed out-
standing options for approximately 1.0 million shares of
ConAgra common stock.  In addition, outstanding warrants
for 0.6 million shares of Golden Valley stock were con-
verted to warrants to purchase 0.5 million shares of
ConAgra common stock at $40.32 per share.  The transac-
tion has been accounted for as a pooling of interests.  The
exchange ratio and share amounts above have been revised
to reflect ConAgra's 3-for-2 stock split on December 2,
1991.  The historical financial statements of the Company
have been restated to give effect to the acquisition as though
the companies had operated together from the beginning of
the earliest period presented.
	On January 2, 1992, all of the outstanding capital stock
of Arrow Industries, Inc. was exchanged for 5,250,000


shares of ConAgra common stock in a transaction
accounted for as a pooling of interests.  Financial informa-
tion for periods prior to this transaction has not been
restated because of immateriality and, accordingly, results of
operations have been included since the date of acquisition.

3. RECEIVABLES

	During September 1990, the Company entered into
agreements to sell, for a period of up to five years, undivided
participation interests in designated pools of receivables,
with limited recourse, in an amount not to exceed $400 mil-
lion at any one time.  During each April of 1994 and 1993,
the agreement was temporarily increased to $500 million for
a period of up to six months, at which time it automatically
reduces to the original $400 million. Participation interests
in new receivables may be sold as collections reduce previ-
ously sold participation interests.  The participation interests
are sold at a discount which is included in Selling,
Administrative and General Expenses in the consolidated
statements of earnings.  In connection with this transaction,
the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements
with two money center bank counterparties which effec-
tively fix the discount rate on $400 million of such
participation interests at 9.4% for five years.  The estimated
fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was an obliga-
tion of $21.3 million as of May 29, 1994.  Gross proceeds
from the sales were approximately $500 million as of May
29, 1994 and May 30, 1993.
	Receivables of Monfort Finance Company include notes
receivable of approximately $254 million and $273 million at
May 29, 1994 and May 30, 1993, respectively.

4.  INVENTORIES

	The major classes of inventories are as follows:


							1994		1993
Hedged commodities ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		$ 723.4		$  656.5
Food products and livestock ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		1,260.7		1,120.2
Agricultural chemicals, fertilizer and feed~~~~~~~~~	322.6		146.1
Retail merchandise ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~		176.0		170.1
Other, principally ingredients and supplies ~~~~~~	401.7		346.3
							$2,884.4	$2,439.2


	The cost of certain food products and livestock invento-
ries stated under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method is
$211.0 million and $133.4 million at May 29, 1994 and
May 30, 1993, respectively.  Had these inventories been
stated at lower of principally first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost
or market, they would have been $41.0 million and $44.2
million greater than reported at May 29, 1994 and May 30,
1993, respectively.

Effective July 4, 1993, the corporation
adopted Statement of Financial Account-
ing Standards No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other than Pensions," (SFAS 106) for
its domestic retiree benefit plans.  Under
SFAS 106, the corporation accrues the
estimated cost of retiree health care
and life insurance benefits during the
employees' active service periods.  The


corporation's previous method of
accounting for postretirement benefits
other than pensions was similar to that
required by SFAS 106, and as of the
start of fiscal 1994, the accumulated
benefit obligation for domestic
employees had been accrued.
  The corporation provides health care
and life insurance benefits to certain
domestic retired employees, their covered


dependents and beneficiaries.  Generally,
employees who have attained age 55 and
who have rendered 10 years of service
are eligible for these postretirement
benefits.  Certain retirees are required to
contribute to plans in order to maintain
coverage.  The domestic postretirement
benefit expense was $15 in 1994, $18 in
1993 and $14 in 1992.  The components
of the 1994 expense were:


                                             1994
Benefits earned by employees                 $  4
Interest on accumulated benefit obligations    11
Net postretirement benefit expense           $ 15

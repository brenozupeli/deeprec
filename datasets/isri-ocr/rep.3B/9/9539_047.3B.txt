Management's Responsibilities for Financial Reporting


The consolidated balance sheets of Baxter International Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders'
equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1993, have been prepared by management, which 
is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles and include some amounts that are based
upon management's best estimates and judgments. The financial
information contained elsewhere in this annual report is consis-
tent with that contained in the financial statements.
  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable 
assurance as to the integrity and reliability of financial reporting.
The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition
that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal 
control, and that the cost of such systems should not exceed the
benefits to be derived therefrom.
  Management believes that the foundation of an appropriate 
system of internal control is a strong ethical company culture 
and climate. To this end the Corporate Responsibility office was
created in 1993 to recommend to the Public Policy Committee of 
the Board of Directors, revisions to the company's existing ethics
and compliance policies, and to direct the implementation of and
compliance with the company's ethics and compliance policies 
and procedures. The Corporate Responsibility office monitors 
compliance through audit programs and the requirement for 
annual representations by senior managers. Additionally, a pro-
fessional staff of corporate auditors reviews the related internal
control system design, the accounting policies and procedures 
supporting this system and compliance therewith. The results of
these reviews are reported annually to the Public Policy and 
Audit Committees.


  Independent certified public accountants perform audits, in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, which
include a review of the system of internal controls and result in 
assurance that the financial statements are, in all material 
respects, fairly presented.
  The board of directors, through its audit committee composed 
solely of non-employee directors, is responsible for overseeing the
integrity and reliability of the company's accounting and financial
reporting practices and the effectiveness of its system of internal
controls. The independent certified public accountants and 
corporate auditors meet regularly with, and have access to, this
committee, with and without management present, to discuss 
the results of the audit work.
  Management assessed the company's system of internal control
as of December 31, 1993, in relation to criteria for effective 
internal control over financial reporting described in "Internal
Control-Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on 
this assessment, it is management's opinion that, as of 
December 31, 1993, the company maintained an effective system 
of internal controls over the preparation of its published interim
and annual financial statements.

CEREAL PARTNERS WORLDWIDE,
 
the company's joint venture with 
Nestl~~, continues to strengthen its
position as the world's No. 2 cereal 
company outside the United States
and Canada. For the 12 months end-
ed March 1994, the period included 
in General Mills' fiscal-year results,


CPW unit volume increased 24 percent and sales grew to nearly $390
million. In the United Kingdom, CP-UK challenged for the No. 2 share 
position with good performance from its core Shredded Wheat and 
Shreddies brands. Original European markets showed continued 
double-digit growth, although the rates of increase were lower than 
in recent years. CPW again paced growth and reported share gains 
in each country. The company completed its first full year of operation
in Mexico, Germany and the ASEAN markets in the southwestern 
Pacific. With operations now expanding to Switzerland, Austria, Belgium,
Greece and Chile, CPW competes in markets accounting for 75 percent 
of cereal consumption outside North America. This represents good
progress toward CPW's goal of $1 billion in sales by the year 2000.


Lucky Charms and five adult cereals that were enhanced to include 25 percent more fruit and nut pieces. Improvements
to Cheerios, Wheaties and several other key brands in 1995 will help sustain Big G's established product vitality. ~
Distinctive cereals introduced in recent years also achieved volume gains. These included Multi-Grain Cheerios, the latest
addition to the cereal market's leading brand franchise. Two new children's cereals, Sprinkle Spangles and Hidden
Treasures, were introduced during 1994 and both contributed incremental volume. Fingos cereal, designed to be eaten 
dry for breakfasts on the run, did not meet expectations and was discontinued. ~ Current new product activity is 


tightly focused on introducing differentiated cereals with strong taste appeal. Reese's Peanut Butter Puffs cereal


entered distribution in May and initial market performance 
is strong. Sun Crunchers, an innovative entry in the adult cereal
segment, will begin entering stores in late August. Additional new
products are in development. ~ Today, cereals are a part of just 30
percent of all breakfast occasions, up from 25 percent a decade ear-
lier. With population growth focused in the child and older adult

Financial Review


focus on improving its cash flows from operations.
Management expects that net debt at the end of 1994 will
be the same as the 1993 year-end level, before the
consideration of net proceeds from divestitures. The company
also intends to utilize the net proceeds from the planned 
divestiture of the diagnostics-products manufacturing and
other non-strategic businesses to reduce net debt, and thus,
anticipates that its net debt to net capital will decline
during 1994, with the goal of reaching the 40% range in the 
years ahead.
  The company's debt ratings of A3 on senior debt by 
Moody's, A- by Standard & Poor's and A by Duff & Phelps
were reaffirmed by each rating agency after the 1993 restruc-
turing announcement. Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps 
have indicated that continuation of these ratings in the future
is dependent on Baxter's successful implementation of the
restructuring program announced in November 1993 (dis-
cussed previously) and the reduction of its financial leverage
which is expected to result from the planned divestiture of its
diagnostics-products manufacturing businesses.
  At December 31, 1993, the company could issue up 
to $300 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 
senior unsecured debt securities under an effective 
registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
  The company intends to fund its long-term obligations 
as they mature by issuing additional debt or through cash
flow from operations. The company believes it has lines of 
credit adequate to support ongoing operational and
restructuring requirements. Beyond that, the company 
believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to attract long-
term capital on acceptable terms as may be needed to support
its growth objectives.
  The company's board of directors authorized the 
purchase of common stock to fund various employee-benefit
plans and for other corporate purposes. The company 
purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $124


million in 1993, and may purchase up to an additional 11
million shares under this authority. Common stock in treasury
increased due to the purchases mentioned above, partially 
offset by shares issued in connection with employee 
benefit programs.
  In February 1994, the board of directors declared the 
dividend on the company's common stock at an annualized 
rate of $1.00 per share. The company plans to increase future
dividends in line with improvements in earnings and cash 
flow performance.

Litigation

See the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements titled "Legal Proceedings" for a detailed 
description of the company's litigation.
  The company has been named as a potentially responsible 
party for unsettled claims for cleanup costs at 18
hazardous waste sites. The company was a significant 
contributor to waste disposed on only one of these sites, the
Thermo-Chem site in Muskegon, Michigan. The company 
expects that the total cleanup costs for this site will be
between $37 million and $82 million, of which the 
company's share will be approximately $5 million. This 
amount has been reserved and reflected in the company's
financial statements.
  In all of the other sites, the company was a minor 
contributor and therefore, does not have information on the
total cleanup cost. The company has, however, in most of 
these cases, been advised by the potentially responsible party
of its roughly estimated exposure at these sites, which, in the
aggregate, totals approximately $5 million.
  The company is a defendant in a number of other 
claims, investigations and lawsuits. Based on the advice of 
counsel, management does not believe that these actions, 
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on the company's operations or its consolidated 
financial condition.

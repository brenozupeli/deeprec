emphasis there are renal therapy and
cardiovascular medicine.  Baxter has a
strong position in the Japanese market
for peritoneal dialysis (PD).  The
company also plans to increase its
presence in the Japanese market for
basic hospital supplies.
  In terms of current markets, Japan
and the European Union comprise by
far the largest share of Baxter's
international business today.  But the
long-term opportunities are equally
attractive in the developing nations of
Asia, Latin America and the former
Soviet bloc, where Baxter is establishing
a major presence.

  I n developing nations, economic and
medical development are closely
related.  As countries create more
wealth and more income, one of the first
things they spend it on is health care.
Even relatively small increases in
spending on health care create
significant opportunities for Baxter.
  "We're not talking about levels of
medical spending that approach those in
the United States...," Baez says, "we're
talking about countries taking the
next step up.  For example, if Chile's
medical spending as a share of its gross
domestic product were raised to the level
of Spain's, it would increase roughly
50 percent."
  In the developing countries
overall, medical spending per capita is
projected to double in the 1990s.  One of
the most promising areas is East Asia
and the Pacific Rim, which will by itself
account for half the gain in gross world
product and half the growth in worldwide
trade during this decade.
  Baxter's presence in that area also
is growing rapidly.  The company is
building a $30-million plant in
Singapore to manufacture intravenous
and dialysis solutions for the Asian
market.  The company has offices in
Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong.  It is
opening an office in Thailand and adding
staff in Indonesia.  In Korea, Taiwan and
the Philippines, it's involved in
technology transfers where Baxter sells
manufacturing equipment for intravenous


solutions to local companies, trains
their workers, then licenses them to
make products with their trade name.
The company also is working with
distributors in these areas to sell other
lines of products.
  In Australia and New Zealand,
Baxter today is one of the largest
health-care companies.  The company has
consolidated its manufacturing facilities
there and has extremely strong positions
in peritoneal dialysis and intravenous
solutions.  It plans to broaden its product
base in 1994.
  Also in 1994, Baxter hopes to
conclude joint-venture agreements in
India, Indonesia and Thailand for plants
to manufacture dialysis and IV solutions.
"These are significant opportunities,"
Baez says.  "There are almost 900 million
people in India, nearly 190 million in
Indonesia.  Thailand has about the same
population as England or France.  In all
these areas, we're using entry-level
technology and various kinds of business
arrangements to get established quickly.
From there, we'll branch out."
  Nowhere in Asia, however, is the
population -~ and the opportunity -~
larger than in China.  That country is
poised for an era of rapid growth.  Some
experts believe China's economy will
surpass Japan's by the end of the
decade, and become the largest in the
world by 2012.
  Baxter is building a plant in
Guangdong province and will begin
manufacturing intravenous and dialysis
solutions for the Chinese market in
1995.  Within the next two years, the
company hopes to develop two other
joint-venture manufacturing plants in
China, one for blood-therapy products
and one for additional manufacturing
capacity for intravenous and dialysis
solutions.  In all, the company expects to
invest more than $40 million in China
over the next three years.
  Elsewhere, Baxter is in the process
of acquiring a 50-percent interest in one
of the leading hospital-supply companies
in Turkey.  That company also exports to
neighboring countries, including several
former Soviet republics.


  Baxter's first operation in Russia.
a joint-venture plant to manufacture
surgical instruments, opened in 1993.
Baxter has formed in Russia a hospital-
supply sales and marketing force,
which will market a complete line of
Baxter products.  The company is
considering plans for additional
manufacturing in Russia for intravenous
and dialysis solutions.

  R ussia's economic problems are
formidable, and the political
climate creates additional
uncertainty.  Despite the obstacles, Baez
believes Baxter is correct in establishing
its presence early.  "We're being prudent;
our investment in Russia for 1993
amounted to about $5.5 million," he
says.  "But it's a big market, and the
window of opportunity is open just a
crack right now.  The companies who are
there today will have a big edge over
those who come later."
  The political and economic
situation in Poland, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary is more stable.  "The medical

instruments plant in Russia polishes a

considering plans for additional
manufacturing in Russia.

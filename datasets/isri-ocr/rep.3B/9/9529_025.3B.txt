U.S. Market Share
Sheer Hosiery
(dollar share)


ing of Sara Lee's Personal Products
business announced in June 1994, sheer
hosiery capacity in all major markets is
being adjusted to match market demand.
Concurrently, capacity for more casual
products, such as tights, opaques and
trouser socks, is being increased.  These
changes will enable Sara Lee to better
capitalize on demand in all legwear
categories, while maintaining leading
market shares.
  Sara Lee will continue to build brand
equity through increased advertising
support and strategic package and dis-
play redesigns.  In addition, an extensive
public awareness campaign designed to
convey messages about the quality,
comfort and functionality of sheer
hosiery products is under way.  In adver-
tising, quality improvements and fea-
tures that enhance appearance are being
emphasized at all price points.
  L'eggs has begun reengineering prod-
uct displays, simplifying the purchase
decision with quicker access to informa-
tion regarding fit, appearance, comfort
and specific product features.
  In Europe, the Dim brand has
undergone an entire packaging and
advertising redesign aimed at reestab-
lishing the dominance of this strong
megabrand and more clearly communi-
cating product attributes.


Major New Products

Product development in both the United
States and Europe is focusing on value-
added products to drive sales in the
sheer hosiery business and capitalize
on emerging trends in casual legwear.
  In the United States, 15 products
were either launched during the latter
half of fiscal 1994 or will be introduced
in early fiscal 1995.
  Hanes introductions included two
products offering waist-to-toe figure
control: Smooth Illusions hosiery, which
combines body contouring with a sheer
appearance, and the more moderately
priced Profiles brand.  Other successful
introductions were Silk Reflections Soft
Touch microfiber hosiery and the Silk
Reflections Plus product for full-figured
women.  During fiscal 1995, Hanes will
feature a new line of casual legwear for
younger women through its E.G. Smith
designer label.
  In fiscal 1994, L'eggs New Sheer
Energy hosiery, with enhanced comfort
and fit, was introduced nationally.
L'eggs also introduced sheer and casual
legwear under the Hanes Her Way
brand, Color Me Natural hosiery for
African-American women, and a new
toning and shaping product, Sheer
Energy Shapers.
  Control-top, microfiber and ultra-


sheer features are the focus of new or
improved hosiery in Europe as well.
The Filodoro Group, a leading Italian
hosiery manufacturer acquired in fiscal
1993, will expand product offerings
in the children's category and begin
distribution of its Philippe Matignon
brand in France.

Global Opportunities

Long-term profitability for Sara Lee's
hosiery business will be fueled by pro-
gressive new product development, as
well as initiatives and acquisitions that
open new markets.
  Fiscal 1994 acquisitions included The
South African Hosiery Company (Pty.)
Ltd., which markets products under
several brand names in South Africa,
and Peri Shoji Co., Ltd., which further
established Sara Lee hosiery in Japan.
Sara Lee acquired a majority ownership
position in Shanghai Vocal Enterprise
Ltd., a Chinese hosiery company, early
in fiscal 1995.
  Geographic expansion continued in
the Americas, with the Hanes and L'eggs
brands going into full distribution in
Canada during fiscal 1994.  In addition,
the L'eggs brand and designer collection
of Donna Karan hosiery were introduced
in Mexico and Japan.

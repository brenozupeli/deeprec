Williamson says. "The bottom-line
pressure is tremendous. Hospitals have
to get control of their costs. They have to
compete for business. In local markets, 
reform is already happening. Major
alliances among former competitors are 
being formed to gain a competitive edge
in the new environment. As a 'value- 
added' service to hospitals, BCC has no 
strategy to grow except as demand
dictates, and the demand for our services
is growing rapidly."
  Baxter Corporate Consulting
services are offered exclusively to 
customers of Baxter's Corporate Program,
which offers hospitals a variety of 
incentives to increase their business with
Baxter. The program offers financial 
incentives, based on sales volume, as
well as a number of exclusive value-
added services, such as those provided
by Baxter Corporate Consulting. 
  Another value-added service 
available to Corporate Program 
customers is the AccessTM program,
which offers hospitals services that are
beyond Baxter's own expertise through
alliances with leading firms in other 
industries. Access associate Comdisco,
for example, helps hospitals manage
capital-equipment expenditures. Waste
Management helps them manage their
waste stream. Kraft helps them manage
food service. North American Paper


provides systems for more efficient
information management, and Trammell
Crow helps hospitals manage property.
Last year, more than 1,000 hospitals 
took part in Access -~ and saved 
$21 million as a result.
  Baxter sales per bed are three 
times as high among Corporate Program 
customers as among other customers.
Baxter's 2,231 Corporate Program 
customers represent almost one-third of
the total beds in the U.S. hospital market.

A s hospitals head toward 
capitated reimbursement -~
reimbursement on a per-patient 
basis -~ it is a natural extension for them
to want to capitate their costs as well. All
of Baxter's programs that help hospitals 
reduce costs are building blocks in an 
overall strategy geared toward offering 
hospitals a comprehensive package of
products and services that can be costed 
to fit that new environment. The 
challenge is being able to bring together
the company's resources in an efficient,
coordinated way.
  One of the most significant steps 
now being taken to make this happen is a
complete redirection of Baxter's domestic
sales force to implement companywide a 
highly successful "team-selling"
approach. Over the past three years, the 
company has used this approach on a 


pilot basis in more than 600 U.S. 
hospitals. Sales in those accounts have
grown 50 percent faster than sales in 
hospitals where the company has not 
used this approach.
  "Simply put, we're making Baxter 
a lot easier to do business with," says Joe
Damico, group vice president, Field 
Sales. "This structure provides one 
'quarterback,' one point person, to 
coordinate all of Baxter's activities for
each customer."
  The teamwork approach extends to 
the multihospital-system arena as well.
"We are lining up our directors and 
vice presidents to work with Baxter's 
hospital teams and meet the needs of
multihospital systems as 'One Baxter,'"
says Terrance J. Mulligan, group vice
president, Multi-Hospital Systems/
Corporate Marketing.
  In the past, as many as 30 Baxter 
sales representatives may have called on
one hospital. Under the new organization, 
an account manager, supported by sales 
representatives from each of Baxter's 
businesses, will represent Baxter as a 
team to that customer.
  The new structure puts customer 
needs ahead of divisional priorities. It
breaks down old divisional conflicts or
inefficiencies. For example, in 1993, 
California Healthcare System (CHS), a
regional alliance of four hospitals in the
San Francisco Bay area, sought to reduce
its supply expenses by seeking a prime-
vendor relationship for all four of its 
hospitals. Baxter won the contract, based 
largely on the teamwork involved in 
presenting the company's capabilities in 
a way that addressed all areas of need
outlined by CHS.
  "I look at CHS as a model for how 
we will be dealing with an increasing 
number of customers," says Mulligan.


Under Baxter's managed-cost 
program, the company delivers a 
hospital's supplies in the form of
"product modules," which contain all
items needed for a specific procedure.
Here, operating-room staff at Long 
Beach Community Hospital open a 
module prior to surgery.

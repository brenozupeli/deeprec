  To speed patient diagnosis in busy
hospitals and health care centers, we intro-
duced the Matrix LR 3300 laser imager,
which processes more than 300 films per 
hour. Another efficiency enhancer is our
new Scopix LT-IR infrared laser film,
which provides excellent results for many
diagnostic methods, including magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound.
Less time is spent retrieving and loading
different kinds of films for different tech-
niques, a valuable savings for patients 
and physicians.
  In another milestone for the technical 
imaging industry, we developed the


For photo dealers and lab operators,
we expanded our successful Partner Pro-
gram, which offers detailed, personal 
training and guidance in retail merchan-
dising, sales promotion and technical
service. Our service was recognized by 
honors such as Woolworth's 1993 Vendor
Excellence Award and the International 
Award for Outstanding Performance from 
the American Society of Photofinishers.
  Our vision for graphic systems was to 
provide a single resource for our cus-
tomers by integrating our prepress sys-
tems with the sales and service solutions 
our customers need to make their own


ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS

At Agfa, we place a major emphasis on 
environmental responsibility. Representa-
tive of these efforts is our photo imaging
system's EARTH program (Environmental
Assistance and Response That Helps).
EARTH helps customers reduce plastic bot-
tle and liquid waste during processing. In
our graphic systems business, we developed 
a comprehensive manual that helps prepress 
customers learn how to apply current
knowledge in the waste reduction field to
their own business practices.
  To better serve our customers in North
America, we opened a plant at our Bushy


IMPAX image management and archiving 
system, used to electronically send medi-
cal images from location to location for
instant diagnosis and archiving.
  We also did well in our motion picture 
film business. Agfa's CP-10 film, on which 
"The Fugitive," "Free Willy," "Sommersby" 
and other movies in 1993 were printed,
gained immediate acceptance for its sharp-
ness and dye stability, and the reduced envi-
ronmental impact of its processing. CP-10 
is a polyester-based film with no conven-
tional carbon black backing, resulting in a 
significant reduction in water consumption.

CUSTOMER SERVICE A TOP PRIORITY

In addition to emphasizing technological
advancement, Agfa put forth unprecedented 
efforts in 1993 to solidify customer service 
as a top priority.


businesses successful. In 1993 that vision
became a reality.
  We also developed a stronger dealer
partnership by supporting our dealers with
enhanced technical, training and consult-
ing programs, including the Agfa Center 
for Education, or ACE, a facility in Teter-
boro, N.J., for instruction and training on
all Agfa electronic and photographic pre-
press systems.
  Driven in part by major restructuring 
in the way national and regional hospital
associations are run, customer service 
requirements rapidly changed in the med-
ical imaging field. In response, we in-
creased our marketing efforts toward large
hospital and health care systems, regional-
ized our field sales and service staffs and
instituted other changes to optimize cus-
tomer support.


Park, S.C., site. This operation slits and
packages color photographic paper and 
soon will add X-ray and graphic arts films
to its repertoire. We have made protecting 
the environment a focus at this new plant.
In addition to using recycled packaging
for our color photo paper, we introduced a 
recycling program that reduces the amount
of waste associated with the fiber cores
inside rolls of photo paper. Our plant was
the first of its kind to initiate such exten-
sive environmental efforts for photo-
graphic paper.
  From packaging innovation, to the
reduction of silver, ammonium compounds 
and fixer, to new technologies that help 
our customers meet their environmental
commitments, the Agfa Division is laying
the groundwork for a cleaner, better world
in which to live and work.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON FINANCIAL INFORMATION


Management of Sara Lee Corporation is
responsible for the preparation and
integrity of the financial information
included in this annual report.  The
financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and, where
required, reflect our best estimates
and judgments.
  It is the corporation's policy to main-
tain a control-conscious environment
through an effective system of internal
accounting controls supported by formal
policies and procedures communicated
throughout the corporation.  These con-
trols are adequate to provide reasonable
assurance that assets are safeguarded
against loss or unauthorized use and to
produce the records necessary for the
preparation of financial information.
There are limits inherent in all systems
of internal control based on the recogni-
tion that the costs of such systems
should be related to the benefits to be
derived.  We believe the corporation's
systems provide this appropriate balance.
  The control environment is comple-


mented by the corporation's internal 
auditors, who perform extensive audits
and evaluate the adequacy of and the
adherence to these controls, policies
and procedures.  In addition, the corpo-
ration's independent public accountants
have developed an understanding of our
accounting and financial controls, and
have conducted such tests as they
consider necessary to support their
report below.
  The board of directors pursues its
oversight role for the financial state-
ments through the Audit Committee,
which is composed solely of outside
directors.  The Audit Committee
meets regularly with management, the
corporate internal auditors and Arthur
Andersen LLP, jointly and separately,
to receive reports on management's
process of implementation and adminis-
tration of internal accounting controls,
as well as auditing and financial
reporting matters.  Both Arthur
Andersen LLP and the internal
auditors have unrestricted access to
the Audit Committee.


  The corporation maintains high
standards in selecting, training and
developing personnel to help ensure
that management's objectives of
maintaining strong, effective internal
controls and unbiased, uniform reporting
standards are attained.  We believe it is
essential for the corporation to conduct
its business affairs in accordance with
the highest ethical standards as
expressed in Sara Lee Corporation's
Code of Conduct.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders,
Sara Lee Corporation:
  We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of
SARA LEE CORPORATION (a
Maryland corporation) AND SUBSID-
IARIES as of July 2, 1994, July 3, 1993
and June 27, 1992, and the related 
consolidated statements of income,
common stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the
period ended July 2, 1994.  These
consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Corporation's
management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accord-
ance with generally accepted auditing


standards.  Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the
overall consolidated financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
  In our opinion, the consolidated finan-
cial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Sara Lee Corporation


and Subsidiaries as of July 2, 1994,
July 3, 1993 and June 27, 1992, and
the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended July 2, 1994 in
conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
  As explained in the Notes to
Financial Statements, the Corporation
adopted the requirements of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," effective July 4, 1993.

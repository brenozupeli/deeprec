FINDING NEW LIVES FOR PLASTICS


Recycling is vitally impor-
tant to Miles and especially 
to our polymers businesses. 
Throughout the company, 
whenever practical and
feasible, waste materials


from our production processes are recycled into
production systems, reducing landfill contribu-
tions and providing manufacturing efficiencies.
  As a major supplier of engineering thermo-
plastics and polyurethane raw materials and sys-
tems to American industry, our Polymers Division


is an active participant in key plastics organiza-
tions such as the American Plastics Council and
the Polyurethane Recycling and Recovery Coun-
cil, which are addressing recycling on an industry-
wide basis.
  We also are dedicated to creating new
recycling technologies that use post-consumer
plastics waste to manufacture new products and
to sharing these technologies with our customers.
  For example, the front close-out panel on
certain Jeep Renegade models is made of
100 percent recycled polyurethane bumpers from
Chrysler minivans. Another viable option being 
pursued by the industry is the recycling of auto-


motive seat cushion foam into carpet underlay.
This is a promising venture due to the consider-
able size of the carpet underlay market in the 
United States.
  As part of the Polymers Division's "from con-
cept to finished product" customer service, our
technical experts also work with customers to
help them design products for recyclability.
  With this dual approach - teamwork with 
other industry suppliers and teamwork with our
customers to address their specific needs -
we can continue to contribute effectively to
progress in recycling.


the advantage of soil application and
requires just one-eighth the dosage of
competing products. This means greater 
safety for farmers and increased protec-
tion for the environment. 

LEADING-EDGE ADVANCEMENTS

In conjunction with environmental con-
siderations, our businesses and our cus-
tomers were challenged by the overall
sluggishness of the chemical industry.
This made cost economies and leading-
edge performance advancements critical 
for retaining or gaining market share.
  Responding to cost efficiency demands
in the automotive industry, we introduced a
low-density filler for our Bayflex reaction in-
jection molding (RIM) polyurethane systems.
This filler helps automakers reduce the costs 
for bumper fascias.
  Also in the automotive market, the


blocked polyisocyanates of the coatings
business were the formulation bases for 
new one-component polyurethane clear-
coats. Offering properties comparable to 
two-component polyurethane clearcoats,
these coatings can be applied using one-
component equipment. As a result, auto-
makers no longer need major equipment 
investments to obtain the performance ben-
efits of polyurethane clearcoat technology.
  Our Palomar blue pigment was a suc-
cessful new product, fueled by the popu-
larity of vibrant blue-green car finishes.
And Quindo violet pigment will help our 
organic pigments business maintain its
worldwide leadership role in supplying 
pigments that meet - and anticipate - the
latest styling trends in automotive coat-
ings. This business also was strengthened 
in 1993 with the dedication of a new 
organic pigments manufacturing plant


and pilot production facility at our Bushy
Park, S.C., site.
  In direct response to long-standing 
industry needs, Polysar Bromobutyl 2040
was introduced to supplement our line of 
halobutyl products for use in tire innerlin-
ers. In the polybutadiene rubber market,
we retained our position as market leader
in North America, with the majority of 
sales achieved in the tire industry. Our
rubber chemicals business gained market 
share, with antidegradant and accelerator
products among the top performers.
  Facilitating the fully automatic and
waste-free manufacture of intricate rubber
parts, our Baysilone liquid silicone rubber 
attained an outstanding growth rate in 
1993 for products ranging from computer 
keypads to baby bottle nipples.
  For the medical device industry, we
introduced a gamma radiation sterilizable


Old polyurethane foam from
automotive seating can be 
ground, reprocessed and then
molded into new seat 
cushions.


Brunswick challenged 
Miles to develop an
elastomer for a new 
bowling ball -~ the
result is the Teal Rhino
Pro, shown with Martin
Kury of the ball's 
development team.

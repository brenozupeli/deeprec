	The tax effect of temporary differences and carryforwards
that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and
liabilities consist of the following:


						1994			1993
					Assets	Liabilities	Assets	Liabilities

Depreciation and amortization ~~~~~~~ $  -~	$291.9		$  -~	$278.2
Nonpension postretirement benefits ~~ 166.1	   -~		154.0	  -~
Other noncurrent liabilities which will
  give rise to future tax deductions~~~~~ 292.1	   -~		306.6	  -~
Tax benefits of acquired companies ~~~ 17.8	   -~		60.5	  -~
Deferred state taxes~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 45.3	   -~		41.4	  -~
Accrued expenses~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 40.5	   -~		41.2	  -~
Others ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 64.0	88.6		67.4	99.2
Valuation allowance~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (230.5)	   -~		(229.4)	  -~
					$395.3	$380.5		$ 441.7	$377.4


	Deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation
allowance as realization of some portion of these future tax
benefits is subject to significant uncertainties.  Favorable reso-
lution of these uncertainties would result in a reduction in the
valuation allowance which would principally reduce goodwill.
	Income taxes paid were $203.9 million, $194.3 million and
$151.6 million in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

15.  COMMITMENTS

	Certain facilities and transportation equipment are leased
under agreements expiring at various dates during the next
fourteen years.  Management expects that in the normal course
of business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by
other leases.  Substantially all leases require payment of prop-
erty taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to
rental payments.
	A summary of rent expense charged to operations follows:


					1994	1993	1992
Cancelable~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ $101.8	$103.7	$ 99.3
Noncancelable ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 130.0	128.7	126.7
					$231.8	$232.4	$226.0


	A summary of noncancelable operating lease commitments
for fiscal years following May 29, 1994 are as follows:


						Type of Property
Fiscal Years				Real and Other	Transportation
Ending in			  	Property	Equipment

1995 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ $ 89.8		$31.6
1996 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 74.8		27.1
1997 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 63.0		22.1
1998 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 50.4		18.2
1999 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 39.5		17.5
Later Years ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 133.3		22.1


	In connection with its trading activities, the Company
had letters of credit and performance bonds outstanding at
May 29, 1994, aggregating approximately $581.9 million.

16.  CONTINGENCIES

	With respect to operations of the Company excluding
the transaction discussed below, there was no litigation at
May 29, 1994 which, in the opinion of management,
would have a material adverse effect on the financial posi-
tion of the Company.
	On August 14, 1990, ConAgra acquired Beatrice
Company.  The Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries
(Subsidiaries) are engaged in various litigation proceedings
incident to their respective businesses and in various environ-
mental and other matters.  Beatrice and various of its
Subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify divested businesses or
the purchasers thereof for various legal proceedings and tax
matters.  The federal income tax returns of Beatrice and its
predecessors for the fiscal years ended 1985 through 1987
have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service and a
report has been issued.  The findings contained in the examin-
ing agent's report have been timely protested and negotiations
with the Appellate Division of the Internal Revenue Service
are under way in an attempt to resolve disputed items.
Disputed items being negotiated with the Appellate Division
of the Internal Revenue Service include proposed deficiencies
relating to previously filed carryback claims to fiscal years
ended prior to 1985 (principally fiscal years ended 1982
through 1984).  Additionally, the federal income tax returns
of Beatrice and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal years
ended 1988 and 1989, have been audited by the Internal
Revenue Service and a report has been issued.  Management
intends to protest the unagreed findings of the examining
agent's report and to negotiate disputed items with the
Appellate Division of the Internal Revenue Service.  Various
state tax authorities are also examining tax returns of Beatrice
and its predecessors for prior taxable years, including, in the
case of one state, years back to fiscal 1978.  It is expected that
additional claims will be asserted for additional taxes.  It is not
possible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that
may arise from these matters which at any given point in time
will be at various stages of administrative and legal proceed-
ings and will aggregate hundreds of millions of dollars.
Substantial reserves for these matters have been established
and are reflected as liabilities on the Subsidiaries' balance
sheets.  The liabilities include accrued interest on the tax
claims.  After taking into account liabilities that have been
recorded and payments made, management is of the opinion
that the disposition of the above matters will not have a mate-
rial adverse effect on ConAgra's financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

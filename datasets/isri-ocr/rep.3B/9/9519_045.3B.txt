* $5.1 billion included in Other accrued expenses and liabilities, $1.6 billion included in Other liabilities, and $3.6 billion included in Plant,
Rental Machines and Other Property in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 1993.


During 1991, the company also recorded a restructuring charge of $3.7 billion before taxes ($2.9 billion after
taxes or $5.03 per common share). The actions contemplated in the 1991 charge were associated with work force
reductions and relocations, facility consolidations, and other related items, which have been essentially completed.

The company records restructuring charges against operations and provides a reserve based upon the best
information available at the time the decision is made to undertake the restructuring action. The reserves 
are subsequently utilized when specific restructuring criteria are met, indicating the planned restructuring
action has occurred. Work-force-related reserves are considered utilized at payment for either termination or
acceptance of other contractual arrangements. Manufacturing capacity reserves are considered utilized based
on execution of planned actions at each affected location. The reserve for excess space is utilized when the 
remaining lease obligations are settled, or the space has been vacated and subleased.

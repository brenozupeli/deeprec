We sponsor several plans that provide health care benefits to
the majority of our retirees. The salaried plan is contributory
with retiree contributions based on years of service.
  We fund plans for certain employees and retirees on an
annual basis. In 1994, 1993 and 1992 we contributed $38.3 
million, $30.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively. Plan 
assets consist principally of listed equity securities and U.S.
government securities.
  Components of the postretirement health care expense are
as follows:


Fiscal Year
Expense (Income) in Millions   1994  1993  1992
Service cost-benefits earned  $ 5.6   $ 3.6  $3.5
Interest cost on accumulated 
benefit obligation  14.0  11.0  9.7
Actual return on plan assets  (1.5)  (3.9)  (3.0)
Net amortization and deferral  (4.5)  (1.0)  (1.2)
Net postretirement expense   $13.6  $ 9.7  $9.0


The funded status of the plans and the amount recognized 
on our consolidated balance sheets are as follows:


In Millions   May 29, 1994   May 30, 1993

Accumulated benefit obligations:
Retirees   $ 36.3  $ 48.7  $ 80.0
Fully eligible active employees  12.7  8.0  19.3
Other active employees  27.0  48.5   70.4
Accumulated benefit obligations   76.0  105.2  169.7
Plan assets at fair value   89.3   7.4   60.8
Accumulated benefit obligations

plan assets   (13.3)  97.8  108.9
Unrecognized prior service cost  .1  12.2   14.3
Unrecognized net loss  (28.1)  (27.7)  (51.1)
Accrued (prepaid)
postretirement benefits   $(41.3)  $ 82.3   $ 72.1


  The discount rates used in determining the actuarial pres-
ent value of the benefit obligations were 8.8% and 8.5% in 
1994 and 1993, respectively. The expected long-term rate of 
return on assets was 10%.
  The health care cost trend rate increase in the per capita
charges for benefits ranged from 6.2% to 9.8% for 1995
depending on the medical service category. The rates gradually
decrease to 4.4% to 5.7% for 2007 and remain at that level 
thereafter. If the health care cost trend rate increased by one per-
centage point in each future year, the aggregate of the service 
and interest cost components of postretirement expense would 
increase for 1994 by $3.1 million and the accumulated benefit
obligation as of May 29, 1994 would increase by $24.6 million.


In 1994, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (SFAS) No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits." The cumulative effect as of May 31,
1993 of changing to the accrual basis for severance and dis-
ability costs was a decrease in net earnings of $17.3 million
($.11 per share).

We have profit-sharing plans to provide incentives to key indi-
viduals who have the greatest potential to contribute to cur-
rent earnings and successful future operations. These plans 
were approved by the Board of Directors upon recommenda-
tion of the Compensation Committee. The awards under these 
plans depend on profit performance in relation to pre-estab-
lished goals. The plans are administered by the Compensation
Committee, which consists solely of outside directors. Profit-
sharing expense, including performance unit accruals, was 
$1.7 million, $7.3 million and $8.8 million in 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively.

We adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" as
of May 31, 1993. The adoption of SFAS 109 changed our
method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred 
method to the asset and liability method. Deferred income
taxes reflect the differences between assets and liabilities recog-
nized for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized 
for tax purposes measured using the current enacted tax rates. 
The cumulative effect of adoption was an increase in net earn-
ings of $17.5 million ($.11 per share).
  The components of earnings before income taxes and the 
income taxes thereon are as follows:


Fiscal Year

Earnings (loss) before 
income taxes:
U.S.    $746.4  $887.2  $818.3

independent auditors' report


The Stockholders and Board of Directors
ConAgra, Inc.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConAgra, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 29, 1994 and
May 30, 1993, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, common stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years (fifty-two/fifty-three weeks) in the period ended May 29, 1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
ConAgra, Inc.  and subsidiaries as of May 29, 1994 and May 30, 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years (fifty-two/fifty-three weeks) in the period ended May 29, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

  As discussed in Note 17, the consolidated financial statements give effect to the Company's adoption, effective June 1, 1992, of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."

The Conduct of Our Affairs
The major objectives of the company are expressed in terms of 
return on stockholders' equity, and growth in trend line earning
power.  As we conduct ourselves in the pursuit of our existing
businesses and in the growth of our businesses in an ethical and 
moral way, we must also fulfill our commitments to our govern-
ment, to our society and to ourselves as individuals.  In one sense,
ethics involves the point of view that suggests we live in a glass
bowl, and we should feel comfortable with any actions we take,
if they were shared publicly.  Further, we will conduct our affairs
within the law.

Should there be evidence of possible malfeasance on the part of
any officer or member of management, each employee must feel the
responsibility to communicate that to the appropriate party.  This is
a commitment that each of us must undertake and not feel that it
is a high-risk communication, but that it is expected and, indeed,
an obligation.

Principal Officers
The principal officers of the company include, among oth-
ers, those listed on pages 28 and 29 of this report.  The principal
officers are responsible for maintaining throughout the com-
pany a system of internal controls which protect the assets of
the company on a reasonable and economic basis.  They also are
responsible for maintaining records which permit the prepara-
tion of financial statements that fairly present the financial 
condition and results of operations of the company in accor-
dance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Audit Committee of the Board
The Audit Committee of ConAgra's Board of Directors is
composed entirely of outside directors and recommends the
appointment of the company's independent public accoun-
tants.  The Audit Committee meets regularly, and when 
appropriate separately, with the independent public accoun-
tants, the internal auditors and financial management.  Both
the independent public accountants and the internal auditors
have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee.

1993 Compared to 1992

Otis segment revenues decreased $94 million (2%) in 1993. The
impact of currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar reduced 
revenues by approximately $278 million (6%) in 1993. Revenues 
in 1993, exclusive of the translation impact, increased due to higher
service volumes in all regions. In addition, new equipment revenues
were slightly higher in 1993 primarily due to higher volumes in the
European and Latin American regions partially offset by lower 
North American volume.
  Otis segment operating profits increased $31 million (9%) in 
1993. The translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar negatively
impacted operating profits by $38 million. The improved operating
profits reflect the growth in service volumes during 1993. During 
1993, increases in Latin American and European new equipment 
volumes and improvement in Latin American new equipment mar-
gins also contributed to the growth.

Carrier segment revenues increased $152 million (4%) in 1993. 
The translation of a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted 1993
revenues by approximately $115 million (3%). 1993 revenues 
reflect volume increases in the North American, Asia Pacific and
Latin American regions as well as the transportation refrigeration
business. These increases were partially offset by the effects of the
continuing recession in Europe, particularly affecting the Spanish
and Italian operations.
  Carrier segment operating profits increased $43 million (23%)
in 1993. Improved operating profits resulting from increased vol-
umes and margins in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions 
were partially offset by the effects of the continuing recession in
Europe.

Automotive segment revenues were essentially unchanged
from 1992. During 1993 the segment was positively impacted by
increased North American car and light truck production and
European market penetration. These increases were substantially 
offset by the overall reduction in European vehicle production, the
negative translation impact of the stronger U.S. dollar of approxi-
mately $112 million (5%), and the absence of sales in 1993 from
certain automotive business units divested in the third quarter of
1992.
  Automotive segment operating profits increased $13 million 
(10%) in 1993. Operating profits during 1993 reflect the impact of
increased North American production volumes and European mar-
ket penetration. During 1993, these increases were partially offset
by the reduction in European vehicle production, charges to ratio-
nalize certain manufacturing operations in Europe and the absence


of the operating results of certain automotive business units
divested during the third quarter of 1992. In addition, 1992 results
include the gain on sale of these units.

Pratt & Whitney segment revenues decreased $1,076 million 
(15%) in 1993. The decrease in 1993 reflects decreases in commer-
cial and government engine and spare parts sales. Although com-
mercial spare parts were lower than the depressed levels of 1992, 
sales during the second half of 1993 showed modest growth and
exceeded the comparable 1992 period. The overall decrease was par-
tially offset by revenues resulting from the renegotiation of certain
aircraft leases during the second quarter of 1993. 
  Pratt & Whitney segment operating profits increased $398 
million in 1993. The 1992 results include the impact of the charges 
recorded for commercial airline exposures, as well as restructuring
actions. Excluding the impact of these charges, the 1993 results 
decreased $198 million (52%), primarily due to lower commercial
and government engine and spare parts sales, partially offset by the
sale of a participant share in the PW4000 engine program during
1993. In addition, Pratt & Whitney reduced research and develop-
ment expenditures during 1993 as the development phase of the 
PW4084 and PW4168 commercial engine programs approached 
completion.

Flight Systems segment revenues were essentially unchanged 
from 1992. As a result of substantially increased international Black
Hawk shipments, helicopter business revenues in 1993 contributed 
65% to Flight Systems segment revenues. This increase was sub-
stantially offset by reductions in defense electronics and commercial
aerospace volumes in the segment's other businesses.
  Flight Systems segment operating profits increased $83 million
(31%) in 1993. The 1992 results include the impact of the charges 
and restructuring actions recorded during the fourth quarter.
Excluding the impact of these charges, the 1993 results increased
$53 million (18%). The increase resulted primarily from improved
operating performance and increased Black Hawk shipments by
Sikorsky and better than expected contract performance related 
principally to Norden's Multi Mode Radar System contract. These
increases were partially offset by declines in commercial
aerospace volumes at Hamilton Standard and the absence of the
favorable impacts of the settlement of several government contract-
ing claims recorded in 1992.

Interest expense:

  Increased 10% or $24 million from 1993 to 1994.
  Decreased 11% or $31 million from 1992 to 1993.

  Interest expense in 1994 includes $41 million of expense 
resulting from the 1994 change in accounting for the Corporation's 
ESOP. Excluding this effect, interest expense decreased $17 million
or 7% in 1994 compared to 1993.

  At December 31, 1993, $987 million of commercial paper and other notes due in 1994 were classified as non-
current since it is management's intention to refinance this amount on a long-term basis, utilizing proceeds from
the sale of $3.00 cumulative CXY-indexed convertible preferred stock (see Note 17) and an available line of bank
credit with a maturity extending beyond 1994.
  At December 31, 1993, minimum principal payments on senior funded debt, including sinking fund require-
ments, subsequent to December 31, 1994 aggregated $5.896 billion, of which $198 million is due in 1995, $18
million in 1996, $753 million in 1997, $635 million in 1998, $633 million in 1999 and $3.659 billion thereafter.
Included in the 1997 amount of $753 million is approximately $430 million that Occidental intends to initially 
refinance under its bank line of credit that expires in 1997, but with agreement of the parties, may be extended
for a further two years. Unamortized discount is generally being amortized to interest expense on the effective 
interest method over the lives of the related issues.
  At December 31, 1993, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, the capacity for
the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, and for acquisitions of, Occidental's capital stock was
approximately $1.3 billion, assuming that such dividends, distributions and acquisitions were made without
incurring additional borrowings.
  At December 31, 1993, Occidental had available lines of committed bank credit of approximately $1.9 billion,
net of $689 million representing amounts utilized to support commercial paper borrowings. Bank fees on commit-
ted lines of credit ranged from 0.125 percent to 0.25 percent.

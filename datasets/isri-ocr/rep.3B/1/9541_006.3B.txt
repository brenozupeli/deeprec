Capitalizing on Colgate's Strengths
in the Developing World


Colgate has on-the-ground operations in 56 countries in Latin America, Asia, Africa
and Central Europe, where combined sales grew more than 20 percent to nearly 
$3 billion in 1993. The growing prosperity and freer markets in these regions mean
that each year millions of additional people can afford Colgate's products. Colgate is 
taking full advantage of this potential by expanding its well-established brands, build-
ing new plants and extending into new territories as income levels rise.


Popular brands through-
out the developing 
world add to Colgate's 
competitive strength.
Above, a sampling from
seven countries.

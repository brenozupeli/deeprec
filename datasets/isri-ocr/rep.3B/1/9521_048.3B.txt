NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


ical benefit cost of approximately $119 million. The company believes that the cost containment fea-
tures it has previously adopted and the funding approaches under way will allow it to effectively manage 
its retiree medical expenses, but it will continue to monitor the costs of retiree medical benefits and may 
further modify the plans if circumstances warrant.

Postemployment Benefits -~ In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 (SFAS 112), "Employers' Accounting for Postem-
ployment Benefits." This statement establishes standards for accounting for benefits to former or inac-
tive employees after employment, other than retirement benefits. Lockheed will adopt SFAS 112 in 1994, 
the required implementation date. Adoption of SFAS 112 is not expected to have a significant effect on
the company's financial statements.

NOTE 9 - LEASES

Total rental expenses under operating leases net of immaterial amounts of sublease rentals and contin-
gent rentals, were $112 million, $114 million, and $123 million for 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

 Future minimum lease commitments at December 26, 1993, for all operating leases that have a 
remaining term of more than one year were $507 million ($104 million in 1994, $80 million in 1995, $69 
million in 1996, $51 million in 1997, $47 million in 1998, and $156 million in later years). 

 Substantially all real estate leases contain renewal options ranging from one year to 10 years. Certain 
major plant facilities and equipment are furnished by the U.S. government under short-term or cance-
lable arrangements.

NOTE 10 - DEBT

At December 26, 1993, the company had two loan agreements (the 1993 Agreements) with a group of 
domestic and foreign banks. One agreement makes available $1 billion through August 30, 1996, while 
the other agreement makes available $300 million through August 29, 1994. The primary purpose of 
these agreements is to back up the company's commercial paper borrowings.

 There were no borrowings outstanding under either agreement, and no commercial paper borrow-
ings outstanding, at December 26, 1993 (considerable commercial paper borrowing activity took place 
during the year, however, primarily to provide the initial financing of the LFWC acquisition and for tem-
porary working capital needs).

 Borrowings under the 1993 Agreements would be unsecured and bear interest, at the company's 
option, at rates based on the Eurodollar rate or a bank base rate (as defined). The 1993 Agreements 
contain financial covenants relating to equity and debt, and  provisions which relate to certain changes 
in control.

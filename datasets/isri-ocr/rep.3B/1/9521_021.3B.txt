Technology Services -~
The Technology Services Group,
which is made up of new initia-
tives as well as several long-stand-
ing core businesses, increased sales
13 percent and improved profitabil-
ity in 1993. A number of our new
initiatives are still in the invest-
ment phase and, as a whole, are
making good progress. We contin-
ue to evaluate these businesses and
intend to make adjustments if we 
do not realize returns on our 
investment in a reasonable time.

 In 1993, Lockheed celebrated its 
tenth year as NASA's shuttle proc-
essing contractor at Kennedy 
Space Center, Florida. During the 
year, we successfully supported 
seven shuttle missions, including 
the first Hubble Space Telescope 
service mission, an international 
laboratory module payload, an 
advanced communications satel-
lite, and the first flight of a com-
mercial module.

 A special report, commissioned 
by NASA Administrator Daniel S. 
Goldin, described the performance 
of the Lockheed shuttle processing 
team as "the best it has ever 
been...." Safety remains the num-
ber one priority in shuttle process-
ing, and the Lockheed team 
adheres to a comprehensive plan 
to improve quality while reducing 
costs, according to findings of the 
panel chaired by Richard Perry, 
NASA director of Space Flight 
Safety and Mission Assurance 
Division.


When the shuttle Endeavour 
began its journey to the Hubble 
Space Telescope, the crew had 
spent about 700 hours training for 
"extra-vehicular activity" -~ work 
in space outside the shuttle. 
Lockheed played a major part in 
hundreds of hours of underwater 
training as the astronauts perfected 
service techniques for use on the 
Hubble. Our work, which also 
included developing the tool box 
and service equipment for the mis-
sion, is part of Lockheed's support 
for NASA's Johnson Space Center at 
Houston, Texas.

 In 1993, NASA again selected 
Lockheed for the engineering 
services contract at Johnson. The 
award has an initial five-year value 
of about $540 million, and a 10-year 
potential value of $1.5 billion.
Under the contract, Lockheed will 
help develop NASA manned space-
flight programs and provide engi-
neering and scientific support. In 
addition, we will operate and main-
tain NASA's engineering and science 
facilities and laboratories.

 Beyond NASA business, we con-
tinued to expand our sales in 
information services. We have 
many innovative programs directed 
to the municipal services market, 
which we estimate in value at more 
than $116 billion annually. In this 
arena, Lockheed helps cities main-
tain essential services by providing 
highly efficient processing for park-
ing tickets and moving violations, 
and emergency medical services 
billing. In 1993, we generated over 
$300 million for our more than 140 
municipal services clients, including 
most major cities in the United 
States. Internationally, we won new 
contracts in the Netherlands, 
Canada, and the United Kingdom.

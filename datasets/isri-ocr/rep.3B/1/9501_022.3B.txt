  Our chemical earnings improved significantly to $240
million due to continuing cost-cutting, aggressive manage-
ment of our portfolio of assets and the focusing of our busi-
nesses around five strategies.

  Earnings were restrained, however, by the performance
of our olefins and polymers operations.  These operations are
closely tied to the general business cycle and have been in
the down-phase for the last several years.

  We strengthened our position as the world's leading pro-
ducer of purified terephthalic acid (PTA), the preferred raw
material for polyester, by starting expansions at our joint-
venture plants in Asia and by securing a license to build a
world-scale plant in Malaysia.

  Our overall goal is to be the preferred supplier of all our
customers.  We rely on a thorough knowledge of customers'
needs, effective customer service systems, responsiveness
and a proven ability to meet all requirements.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION

Optimize our existing operations

  Optimizing operations means getting the most from
existing assets and divesting those that do not offer an
acceptable return on investment.  Our goal is to direct re-
sources where profitable opportunities fit our capabilities.

  We streamlined by selling assets that did not fit our
strategic goals.  These included Welchem Inc., which makes
oil field production and process chemicals; a Canadian
fibers and yarn plant and a polystyrene plant in California.

  We have programs to yield the most from our assets.
These include eliminating work processes that do not
add value, optimizing use of computers and other
information-related technology and benchmarking our
accounting operations to the best practices of our industry.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION

Globally expand our core businesses

  Our most important commodity chemical, with annual
revenues of about $1 billion, is PTA, the preferred raw mate-
rial for making polyester.  The largest single use for polyester

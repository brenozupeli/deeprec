3.  Cash Flow Information
The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides infor-
mation about changes in cash and cash equivalents, includ-
ing cash in excess of daily requirements that is invested in
marketable securities, substantially all of which have a ma-
turity of three months or less when acquired.  The effect of
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on total cash
and marketable securities balances was not significant.

Net cash provided by operating activities reflects cash
payments for interest and income taxes as follows:


millions of dollars              1993      1992     1991
Interest paid                  $  367    $  550   $  449
Income taxes paid              $  632    $  974   $ 1,341


4.  Inventories
Inventories at December 31, 1993 and 1992, are shown in
the following table:


millions of dollars                1993      1992
Crude oil and petroleum products $  415    $  318
Chemical products                   377       342
Other products and merchandise       21        26
Materials and supplies              297       303
                                $ 1,110    $  989


During the year ended December 31, 1993, the corporation
reduced certain inventory quantities which were valued at
lower LIFO costs prevailing in prior years.  The effect of this
reduction was to increase net income by approximately $50
million.  A smaller LIFO gain was included in 1992.

Inventories carried under the LIFO method represented ap-
proximately 47 percent of total year-end inventory carrying
values in 1993 and 48 percent in 1992.  It is estimated that
inventories would have been approximately $900 million
higher than reported on December 31, 1993, and approxi-
mately $1.3 billion higher on December 31, 1992, if the quan-
tities valued on the LIFO basis were instead valued on the
FIFO basis.

7. Short-Term Obligations
Amoco's short-term obligations consist of notes payable and
commercial paper. Notes payable as of December 31, 1993,
totaled $71 million at an average annual interest rate of 3.2
percent, compared with $75 million at an average annual
interest rate of 3.6 percent at year-end 1992.  Commercial
paper borrowings at December 31, 1993, were $936 million
at an average annual interest rate of 3.4 percent compared
with $143 million at an average annual interest rate of 3.5
percent as of December 31, 1992.  The carrying value of
short-term obligations as of December 31, 1993 and Decem-
ber 31, 1992, approximated estimated fair value.

Bank lines of credit available to support commercial paper
borrowings of the corporation amounted to $490 million and
$500 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
All of these were supported by commitment fees.

The corporation also maintains compensating balances
with a number of banks for various purposes.  Such arrange-
ments do not legally restrict withdrawal or usage of avail-
able cash funds.  In the aggregate, they are not material in
relation to total liquid assets.

8.  Accounts Payable
Accounts payable at December 31, 1993 and 1992, included
liabilities in the amount of $304 million and $342 million, re-
spectively, for checks issued in excess of related bank bal-
ances but not yet presented for collection.

9. Long-Term Debt
Amoco's long-term debt resides principally with two Amoco
subsidiaries-~Amoco Company and Amoco Canada.  Amoco
Company functions as the principal holding company for
all of Amoco's petroleum and chemical operations, except
Canadian petroleum operations and selected other
activities.

In the USA, JACUZZI is the world's 
leading manufacturer of whirlpool 
baths. MW manufactures and 
distributes wooden and vinyl clad
windows. HANSON LIGHTING GROUP sells
electrical equipment under the brand
names Progress, Kim, Spaulding,
Prescolite, Moldcast, Liteway and
Columbia Lighting.

HANSON BRICK is Britain's largest brick
manufacturer, producing a range of
products under the Butterley, London
Brick, and Kempston brand names.
HANSON ELECTRICAL SERVICES is a 
leading UK manufacturer of electrical
wiring accessories, circuit breakers 
and motor control equipment.


JACUZZI WHIRLPOOL BATH continued
to lead the industry with the 
introduction of innovative products 
such as the J-Dream II double shower 
system, combining hydromassage,
steam and built-in stereo system and
the J-Shower Tower, a unique bath/
shower combination. Sales were 
especially strong in the USA, Europe 
and Latin America. 1994 was another
record year for this 79 year-old 
company.

MW MANUFACTURERS had record sales
and profit for the second consecutive 
year thanks to geographical expansion
and strong new home construction. 
HANSON LIGHTING GROUP'S earnings were
up 63% with margin improvements
due to material cost reductions, 
productivity gains and improvements  
in distribution. New products included
the immediately successful PGL
Omni at KIM LIGHTING, the Intelect 
ballast and related energy saving 
fixtures at USI LIGHTING, the Orlando
vertical lamp luminaire at SPAULDING
LIGHTING, and over 140 new products 
at PROGRESS LIGHTING.

HANSON BRICK enjoyed increased UK
demand generated by higher levels of
house building. Improved volume 
and some hardening of selling prices
have helped to generate higher
profit and allowed most of the
stock remaining from the building
recession to be cleared.

BUTTERLEY BRICK continued to improve 
its cost base and has successfully
launched house building bricks
from works that have traditionally 
supplied commercial building 
markets, which remain flat.


LONDON BRICK has developed a new
frost-resistant brick by modifying the
traditional Fletton manufacturing
process. This brick, known as the
Kempston Rural Range has won
several awards, including a Business 
Commitment to the Environment
award.

There has been increased investment
at HANSON ELECTRICAL SERVICES on new
automated plant and machinery,
product development and acquisitions.
CRABTREE'S reputation as a market 
leader in UK circuit breakers has been
strengthened further by the purchase
of the SCHOLES GROUP in September
1994 for ~100 million including the
Wylex and Dorman Smith brand circuit
breakers. The VOLEX ACCESSORIES and
MARBOURN ranges of wiring products 
were broadened with the acquisition 
of TRAVELLER INTERNATIONAL, a 
manufacturer of electrical travel goods.

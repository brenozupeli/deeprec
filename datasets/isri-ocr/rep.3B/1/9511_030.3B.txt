ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS


Events of Note

~ In the first quarter the company sold its worldwide connector
systems business to Hicks, Muse and Company, as part of its strategy
for divestiture of non-core businesses.  Proceeds were about $270
million, with negligible impact on earnings.

~ At mid-year, DuPont and Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. (ICI)
completed transactions in which DuPont acquired for about $475 mil-
lion ICI's worldwide fibers business and ICI acquired for $280 million
DuPont's acrylics business, excluding "Corian".  The purchase
strengthens the company's nylon market position, particularly in
Europe, where most of ICI's business was based.  The acrylics sale
had minimal earnings impact.

~ In the third quarter, the company announced additional restructur-
ings and recorded after-tax charges of $1.3 billion, principally for
asset write-offs, the most significant of which were for goodwill,
technology and rationalization of excess capacity in the printing and
publishing businesses.

~ In the fourth quarter, the company completed sales of the
Remington Arms Company and DuPont Canada's "Sclair" polyethyl-
ene business.  A net after-tax gain of $52 million was recorded.
Proceeds of $300 million from the Remington sale were used primari-
ly to retire debt.

~ Also in the fourth quarter, the company took an additional $126
million after-tax charge in connection with the "Benlate" DF 50 fungi-
cide recall.  This additional accrual for "Benlate" DF 50 updates the
estimate of costs based on recent experience of court
trials, review of case histories and rate of spending on litigation.
Adverse changes in estimates for these costs could result in addition-
al future charges.


Restructuring
During 1993, the company announced a number of steps for strategic
restructuring, primarily for improving competitiveness in global mar-
kets, but also to streamline internal organizations and eliminate large
business sectors in favor of smaller, strategic business units.
Restructuring charges of $1,295 million, after taxes, were taken in the 
third quarter.  These include $375 million for employee separation
costs related to the elimination of about 9,000 positions worldwide.
Other charges were for write-offs, principally of goodwill and technol-
ogy arising from printing and publishing acquisitions in the late
1980's, various facilities shutdowns and asset write-downs.  The
latter included write-downs for certain North American petroleum-
producing properties sold in the fourth quarter, polymer production
lines in LaPorte, Texas, nylon textile production lines in Martinsville,
Virginia, and polyester filament production lines in Cooper River,
South Carolina.  It is estimated that 1994 earnings will reflect
more than $300 million of after-tax cost savings related to this
restructuring.

Sales
Sales in 1993 were $37.1 billion, down 2 percent from 1992.  Sales in
the Petroleum segment and the combination of all other segments
were both about 2 percent below 1992.  Lower sales were principally
due to lower prices, partly offset by higher volumes.  The sales decline
for the combined Chemicals, Fibers, Polymers, and Diversified
Businesses segments reflects 4 percent lower sales outside of the 
United States, largely due to adverse exchange effects from a
stronger dollar, partly offset by higher volume.  After adjusting for the 
divestiture of the connector systems business, U.S. sales were up
1 percent, reflecting slightly higher volume and prices.  Fibers had
increased sales resulting from the acquisition of ICI's nylon business,
and Polymers had increased sales to the U.S. automotive industry.

Sales in 1992 were $37.8 billion, 2 percent below 1991, principally
reflecting the absence of sales from the coal business; which has
been accounted for under the equity method since the beginning of
1992.  After adjusting for the coal business, sales were up 2 percent,
principally reflecting higher volumes worldwide.  Currency exchange
rates had no significant effect on the change in sales.

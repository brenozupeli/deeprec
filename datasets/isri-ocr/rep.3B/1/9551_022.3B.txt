CAVENHAM FOREST INDUSTRIES, operating 
over 1.75 million acres of premier
timberland in the US Pacific 
Northwest and the Southeast, is the 
ninth largest private US forest 
company and the thirteenth largest 
US lumber producer. Standing timber 
is more than twenty times the annual
harvest and continues to increase as 
annual new growth exceeds harvest 
by approximately 32%.

DUKE CITY is a small lumber producer
and BROWN MOULDING is a major 
manufacturer and distributor of
unfinished wood moulding.


CAVENHAM reported a fourth consecutive
year of improved performance built 
around extensive timberland holdings 
located in some of the most productive
timber growing regions in the world.
Fertile soil, moderate temperatures
and plentiful rainfall are important 
characteristics of its acreage. The 
wood products facilities are considered
amongst the most efficient and
productive in the industry, highlighted 
by the state-of-the-art technology of
the McComb, Mississippi sawmill.
 
On a sustainable yield basis,
Cavenham harvests approximately
550 million board feet annually.
Continuing reforestation, silviculture,
fertilisation and thinning enhance the
forests' ever-increasing value and
provide the foundation for future
earnings growth. Lumber production
is an important means of adding
value to the timber resource.

A vibrant housebuilding market
fuelled the demand for wood products, 
sending lumber prices up early in the 
year, particularly in the Southeast
where more than 85% of Cavenham's 
lumber production is generated. This 
strong demand created rapidly rising
domestic log prices. In addition, 
continuing restrictions, influenced 
by environmentalists, on Northwest
government-owned timberlands 
contributed to a tight supply. Timber
prices peaked in the second quarter,
but declining demand domestically 
and overseas caused prices to fall
later in the year.

Cavenham has strong cash flow and
this year generated a record ~101
million after investing ~18 million.


Our capital programme continues to
support sawmill efficiency and 
timberland acquisitions. During the
year, small high value timberlands 
were acquired, along with 44,000 acres
of formerly leased forests. Lumber 
production, yield and employee
productivity improved once again.

Steady improvement in sales, earnings
and return on capital employed have 
been experienced over the past 
several years at DUKE CITY LUMBER and 
BROWN MOULDING where both enjoyed
strong sales increases and earnings 
growth of more than 20%.


OPPOSITE:
The importance of our continuing sensitivity
to the environment is shown in the majesty of
a Cavenham second-growth forest in the Pacific
Northwest, preserved for the future through
modern forestry replacement planting techniques.

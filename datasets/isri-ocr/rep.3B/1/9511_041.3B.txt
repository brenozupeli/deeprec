Notes to Financial Statements
	DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
DuPont observes the generally accepted accounting principles
described below.  These, together with the other notes that follow,
are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Changes
In 1992, DuPont adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" and SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes."  The company recorded charges to net income of 
$3,788 ($5.63 per share) and $1,045 ($1.55 per share), respectively,
as of January 1, 1992 for the effects of transition to these two new
standards.  See also Notes 8 and 26.

Basis of Consolidation
The accounts of wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries are
included in the consolidated financial statements.  Investments in
affiliates owned 20 percent or more and corporate joint ventures are
accounted for under the equity method.  Investments in noncorporate
joint ventures of petroleum operations are consolidated on a pro rata
basis.  Other securities and investments are generally carried at cost.

Inventories
Substantially all inventories are valued at cost as determined by the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method; in the aggregate, such valuations are
not in excess of market.  Elements of cost in inventories include
raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.  Stores
and supplies are valued at cost or market, whichever is lower; cost is
generally determined by the average cost method.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) is carried at cost and, except for
petroleum PP&E, is generally classified in depreciable groups and
depreciated by accelerated methods that produce results similar to the
sum-of-the-years' digits method.  Depreciation rates range from 4 per-
cent to 12 percent per annum on direct manufacturing facilities and
from 2 percent to 10 percent per annum on other facilities; in some
instances appropriately higher or lower rates are used.  Generally,
for PP&E acquired prior to 1991, the gross carrying value of assets
surrendered, retired, sold or otherwise disposed of is charged to
accumulated depreciation and any salvage or other recovery therefrom
is credited to accumulated depreciation.  For disposals of PP&E
acquired after 1990, the gross carrying value and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and included in determin-
ing gain or loss on such disposals.

Petroleum PP&E, other than that described below, is depreciated
on the straight-line method at various rates calculated to extinguish
carrying values over estimated useful lives.  When petroleum PP&E is


surrendered, retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, the assets
involved determine if gain or loss is recognized, or the gross
carrying value is charged to accumulated depreciation, depletion
and amortization and any salvage or other recovery therefrom is
credited to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations; replacements
and betterments are capitalized.

Oil and Gas Properties
The company's exploration and production activities are accounted
for under the successful-efforts method.  Costs of acquiring unproved
properties are capitalized, and impairment of those properties, which
are individually insignificant, is provided for by amortizing the cost
thereof based on past experience and the estimated holding period.
Geological, geophysical and delay rental costs are expensed as
incurred.  Costs of exploratory dry holes are expensed as the wells are
determined to be dry.  Costs of productive properties, production and
support equipment, and development costs are capitalized and 
amortized on a unit-of-production basis.

Intangible Assets
Identifiable intangible assets such as purchased patents and
trademarks are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives.  Goodwill is amortized over periods up to 40 years on the
straight-line method.

Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures
Accruals for environmental matters are recorded in operating
expenses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.  Accrued
liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not
discounted.

In general, costs related to environmental remediation are 
charged to expense.  Environmental costs are capitalized if the
costs increase the value of the property and/or mitigate or prevent
contamination from future operations.

Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for 1993 and 1992 has been
determined under SFAS No. 109, which requires use of the asset and
liability approach to accounting for income taxes.  Under that
approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences 
expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
are recovered or paid.  The provision for income taxes represents
income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in
deferred taxes during the year.  Deferred taxes result from differences
between the financial and tax bases of the company's assets and
liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws

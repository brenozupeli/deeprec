  Among the issues confirmed by the Stipulation and Agreement is the ability of Tennessee to collect from customers,
on an accrual basis, the costs of providing benefits other than pensions to retirees.  These costs were previously collected
from customers on a "pay-as-you-go" basis.  The Stipulation and Agreement allowed Tennessee to collect over a 20-year
period the transition obligation related to postretirement benefit costs.  Tennessee had previously expensed these amounts
when FAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," was adopted in 1992.
As a result of this Stipulation and Agreement, Tennessee has established a regulatory asset of $34 million and has
included the income effect of this favorable regulatory development in the income statement caption, "Other income, net."
  On June 25, 1992, the FERC approved a settlement allowing Tennessee to recover from its customers up to
$650 million of excess gas supply costs incurred through July 1, 1992, in resolving take-or-pay costs and payments to
producers to suspend or terminate contracts or to reduce contract prices to market levels.  The settlement also allowed
Tennessee to place into effect, as of July 1, 1992, a Gas Inventory Charge providing a mechanism for the recovery of
these excess gas supply costs until September 1, 1993, the effective date of Tennessee's implementation of Order No. 636.
Tennessee charged to operating expenses that portion of excess gas supply costs incurred prior to the implementation of
Order No. 636 that it cannot recover from customers.
  On April 8, 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 which, together with subsequently issued clarifying Order
Nos. 636-A and 636-B (the "FERC Restructuring Orders"), directed a further sweeping restructuring of the interstate
gas pipeline industry.  The FERC Restructuring Orders required pipelines to: 1) "unbundle" their transportation and
storage services from their sales services, 2) increase pipeline customers' flexibility to change receipt and delivery points
under transportation contracts and to allow release of capacity under those contracts for use by others and 3) separate
interstate pipeline gas sales organizations from interstate pipeline transportation and storage business units.  Under the
FERC Restructuring Orders, rates for pipeline transportation and storage generally remain subject to traditional cost-
of-service regulation but under a rate design which is relatively insensitive to throughput and hence less sensitive to
seasonal variation.  Sales of natural gas by interstate pipelines occur pursuant to a blanket sales certificate under which
price and other terms of sale are set by market forces.  After a series of FERC orders and compliance filings, Tennessee
implemented its Order No. 636 tariff commencing on September 1, 1993, restructuring its transportation, storage
and sales services.
  The FERC Restructuring Orders recognized that transition costs, including gas supply realignment costs, may result
from this restructuring and provided mechanisms for the full recovery of such qualified costs.  Pipelines were encouraged
to propose various mechanisms in the restructuring proceedings to reduce transition costs, including assignment of gas
supply contracts and phasing in of the conversions of the pipeline sales service.  The FERC Restructuring Orders specified
that pipelines would be allowed to make special filings to recover many types of transition costs.
  Tennessee has made multiple filings to begin recovery of certain transition costs already paid or obligated to be
paid in connection with the FERC Restructuring Orders.  Tennessee's filings request authority to: 1) recover, through a
monthly surcharge, one-time gas supply realignment costs and certain related costs incurred to date over a twelve-month
period, 2) direct-bill customers for unrecovered gas costs over a twelve-month period and 3) track and recover, through
an annual surcharge, upstream transportation costs from customers.  The filings were accepted effective September 1,
1993, and made subject to refund pending review.  Hearings have been instituted to review the recovery of the gas supply
realignment costs and the direct billing of unrecovered gas costs.  Tennessee's filings to recover production costs related
to its Bastian Bay facilities have been rejected by the FERC based on the continued use of the gas production from the
field, however, the FERC recognized the ability of Tennessee to file for the recovery of losses upon disposition of these
assets.  Tennessee will seek appellate review of the FERC actions.  Tennessee is confident that the Bastian Bay costs will
ultimately be recovered as transition costs directly related to Order No. 636, and no FERC order has questioned the
ultimate recoverability of these costs.
  The total amount of transition costs that will be incurred by Tennessee will depend upon: 1) developments in
restructuring proceedings involving Tennessee, its customers and other affected parties, 2) the resolution of pending
litigation and 3) the terms of multiple negotiations with individual suppliers.  Until these issues are resolved, Tennessee
cannot finally determine the ultimate amount of one-time realignment costs or other related annual costs it will incur,
nor the amounts which will be recovered from customers.  Tennessee believes that one-time realignment costs will not
exceed $700 million.  At December 31, 1993, Tennessee recorded and deferred approximately $120 million of such one-
time costs which are recoverable from its customers. Tennessee believes that other related annual costs will not exceed
$100 million in 1994, decreasing thereafter over the length of the contracts involved.
  The FERC Restructuring Orders will undergo judicial review, clarifications and formulation of cost recovery details
as the restructuring process proceeds.  However, Tennessee believes that it is entitled to full recovery of all transition costs
it will incur.  Given the fact that the FERC Restructuring Orders contemplate complete recovery by pipelines of qualified
transition costs, Tenneco believes that Tennessee's Order No. 636 restructuring (together with the Order No. 636
restructuring of Tenneco's other interstate pipelines) will not have a material effect on Tenneco's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

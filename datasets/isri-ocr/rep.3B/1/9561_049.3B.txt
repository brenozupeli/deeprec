  At December 31, 1993, Occidental had, for U.S. federal income tax return purposes, a net operating loss carryfor-
ward of approximately $580 million, a business tax credit carryforward of $65 million and an alternative minimum 
tax credit carryforward of $252 million available to reduce future income taxes. To the extent not used, the net oper-
ating loss carryforward expires in varying amounts beginning in 2002 and the business tax credit expires in varying 
amounts during the years 1997 through 2001. The alternative minimum tax credit carryforward does not expire.
  Occidental is subject to audit by taxing authorities for varying periods in various tax jurisdictions. Manage-
ment believes that any required adjustments to Occidental's tax liabilities will not have a material adverse impact
on its financial position or results of operations.

  Occidental has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1.00 per share. In February
1993, Occidental issued 11,500,000 shares of $3.875 cumulative convertible preferred stock. The $3.875 preferred 
stock is redeemable after February 1998, in whole or in part, at the option of Occidental, at redemption prices
declining to $50 per share in and after the year 2003. The $3.875 preferred stock has a liquidation value of $50 per
share plus accumulated unpaid dividends and is convertible at the option of the holder into common stock of
Occidental at a conversion price of $22.76 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. Dividends on the
$3.875 preferred stock at an annual rate of $3.875 per share are cumulative and are payable quarterly in arrears,
when and as declared by Occidental's Board of Directors. Holders of the $3.875 preferred stock have no voting
rights, except in certain circumstances; however, they are entitled to elect additional directors if the equivalent of
six quarterly dividends on the $3.875 preferred stock are accumulated and unpaid.
  In 1992, Occidental redeemed all of its outstanding $12.00 cumulative preferred stock. Occidental had
400,000 shares of $12.00 cumulative preferred stock outstanding throughout 1991 and up until redemption in 
September 1992, with a carrying value of $40 million.
  In 1986, pursuant to a stockholders' rights plan, a dividend of one stock purchase right (right) on each out-
standing share of Occidental's common stock was issued. Similar rights have been, and generally will be, issued in
respect of shares of common stock subsequently issued. Each right becomes exercisable, upon the occurrence of
certain events, for one one-hundredth of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock, par value $1 per
share, at a purchase price of $80 or, under certain circumstances, common stock or other securities, cash or other
assets having a then current market price (as defined and subject to adjustment) equal to twice such purchase
price. The rights currently are not exercisable and will be exercisable only if a person or group either acquires ben-
eficial ownership of 20 percent or more of Occidental's common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer
that would result in ownership of 30 percent or more. The rights, which expire in October 1996, are redeemable
in whole, but not in part, at Occidental's option at any time for a price of $.05 per right.

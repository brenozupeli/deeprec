ACCOUNTING CHANGES      Occidental changed 
its method of accounting for postretirement benefits
other than pensions by adopting SFAS No. 106-
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," effective January 1, 1992. This
statement substantially changed the existing method 
of accounting for postretirement benefits by requiring 
that the cost of these benefits, which are primarily 
health care related, be recognized in the financial
statements during the employees' active working 
careers, rather than the previously permitted practice 
of accounting for such costs as claims were paid. The 
adoption of SFAS No. 106 resulted in an after-tax 
charge against 1992 earnings of $529 million, includ-
ing $513 million which was charged to the 1992 first
quarter earnings for the cumulative effect of this 
accounting change and a charge of $16 million for 
the ongoing effect included in 1992 earnings.
  Occidental also adopted, effective January 1, 1992,
SFAS No. 109-~"Accounting for Income Taxes," which 
requires an asset and liability approach in accounting 
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred
income taxes are recognized, at enacted rates, to
reflect the future effects of tax carryforwards and tem-


porary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year-end. SFAS No. 109 required the 
restatement of assets and liabilities related to pur-
chased businesses to eliminate the previously used
net-of-tax accounting for such assets and liabilities,
resulting in higher carrying values and therefore in
higher operating charges for depreciation, depletion 
and amortization but lower tax expense. This state-
ment also eliminated the concept of the utilization of
net operating loss carryforwards for accounting pur-
poses, which were previously reported as extraordi-
nary items, by requiring the immediate recognition of
losses in the year incurred, subject to realization. The 
adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted in a net benefit to
1992 earnings of $285 million, including a $420 mil-
lion benefit to 1992 first quarter earnings for the
cumulative effect of this accounting change and a 
charge of $135 million attributable to and included in 
1992 earnings.

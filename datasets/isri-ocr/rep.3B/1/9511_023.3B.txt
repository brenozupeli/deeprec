OUTLOOK
Major restructuring initiatives have been undertaken to reduce costs and enhance efficiency.  Further
economic improvement in the United States and recovery in Europe and Japan would increase and
accelerate the benefits of the restructuring programs.  Development of new products and new applica-
tions for existing products provides opportunities for growth in selected markets.


polymers


Engineering polymers, elastomers, fluoropolymers, ethylene polymers,
finishes and performance films are produced to serve industries
including packaging, construction, chemical processing, electrical,
paper, textiles and transportation.  This group also includes the
automotive businesses, which are engaged in manufacturing and
marketing more than 100 DuPont product lines used by the automotive
industry.  Under an initiative begun last year, these businesses are
grouped into strategic business units (see chart inside front cover).


Polymers is on track with a strategy that is focused on core strengths in engineering polymers, ethyl-
ene polymers, fluoropolymers and finishes, to enhance our position in the automotive, packaging,
construction and electrical markets.

Developments during the year included the acquisition of ICI's nylon resins business and the
announcement of a new nylon polymer facility as further steps toward growing our global nylon resins
business.  The ICI move will broaden our base in Europe.  The polymer facility, located on Pulau Sakra,


off Singapore, is needed to meet growing customer demand for DuPont
"Zytel" nylon resin throughout the Asia Pacific region.  Start-up is sched-
uled for 1995.  "Zytel" is used in a wide range of applications, including
automotive and electrical components.  We also purchased Ciba-Geigy's 
PBT (polybutylene terephthalate) polyester business in Germany, which
strengthens our global position in polyester resins and electrical mar-
kets.  Except for "Corian" solid surface material, used in applications
such as sinks and countertops, we sold our acrylics business to ICI as
part of our strategy of focusing resources on those businesses in which
we have unique strengths and the opportunity for global growth.

	A combination of cost-reduction programs and improving market
conditions, primarily in the United States, brought gains late in the year.

1993 VERSUS 1992
Sales were up less than 1 percent as increased sales in the United
States were essentially offset by lower sales in other regions.  A world-
wide 5 percent volume increase was offset by lower prices resulting
principally from the currency exchange effects of a stronger dollar.

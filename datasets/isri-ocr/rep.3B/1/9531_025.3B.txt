   CVN-76

  Our number one priority in 1994
is to secure the CVN-76 nuclear
aircraft carrier contract, which
would add more than $3 billion to
the Newport News backlog.  The
U.S. Department of Defense
included CVN-76 in its fiscal year
1995 budget request, delivered to
Congress in early 1994.  We antici-
pate that CVN-76 will go through
the authorization and appropriation
committees during 1994 and that
authorization for full funding of the
carrier will be approved.

  SHIP REPAIR, CONSTRUCTION

  Newport News continues to get
new business from the aggressive
marketing of its ship repair services.
We have grown from virtually no
commercial repair work in 1991 to
a total of 38 ship repair contracts
completed in 1993.  On the new
construction front, we are pursuing
the international military market
with our new fast frigate design,
which we believe is highly competi-
tive in terms of price and capability.
The revenue generated by each of
these ships would be about the same
as a submarine, and the interna-
tional military business is a good-
sized market.
  We also are competing for com-
mercial ship construction projects
through strategic partnerships
with companies that already enjoy
a strong international presence.
We have had agreements with the
Italian shipyard Fincantieri and with


IHI and Sumitomo of Japan on
a proposal to build a series of lique-
fied natural gas tankers, and even
though that project has now been
delayed, we expect to extend our
cooperation for possible future
opportunities.

   KEY STRATEGIES

  Moving into 1994 Newport
News will continue to follow three
key strategies: to protect our core
business of Navy nuclear work while
aggressively pursuing other Naval
opportunities in ship construction,
refueling, overhaul, and repair, and
nuclear engineering; to build new
business in commercial markets; and
to continue reducing costs.


  Champagne christenings were carried out
in 1993 on the aircraft carrier John C. Stennis
and the submarine Toledo; and two subs,
the Tucson and the Greeneville,
are scheduled for christening in 1994.


  The foundry at Newport News
pours a full range of intricate castings,
from small valve bodies
to stern frames for large ships.

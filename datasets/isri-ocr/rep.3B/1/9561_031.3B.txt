  Occidental's estimated operating expenses in 1993
relating to compliance with environmental laws and
regulations governing ongoing operations were
approximately $110 million, compared with $117 mil-
lion in 1992 and $135 million in 1991. The 1993
amount included $71 million in the chemical division,
$34 million in the oil and gas division and $5 million 
in the natural gas transmission division. In addition, 
estimated capital expenditures for environmental com-
pliance were $83 million in 1993, compared with $80
million in both 1992 and 1991. The 1993 amount 
included $47 million in the oil and gas division, $32
million in the chemical division and $4 million in the
natural gas transmission division. Divisional operating 
and capital expenditures for environmental compli-
ance are expected to increase in the future.

FOREIGN INVESTMENTS    Portions of Occiden-
tal's oil and gas assets are located in countries outside
North America, some of which may be considered 
politically and economically unstable. These assets
and the related operations are subject to the risk of 
actions by governmental authorities and insurgent 
groups. Occidental attempts to conduct its financial
affairs so as to protect against such risks and would 
expect to receive compensation in the event of
nationalization. At December 31, 1993, the carrying 
value of Occidental's oil and gas assets in countries 
outside North America aggregated approximately
$1.38 billion, or approximately 8 percent of Occiden-
tal's total assets at that date. Of such assets, approxi-
mately $530 million was located in Latin America, 
and substantially all of the remainder were located in
the Middle East, West Africa, Russia and Pakistan.

1994 BUSINESS OUTLOOK    Economic growth
has been rather sluggish in recent years. During 1994,
the rate of growth is expected to increase moderately 
in the United States and Japan and is expected to 
improve in other industrial Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development countries,
particularly if energy prices remain weak. The combi-
nation of continued economic growth and low energy 
prices should in turn boost consumption. The new 
GATT and NAFTA trade agreements also are expected 
to give a boost to the worldwide economy. On a 
global scale, health, environmental and safety issues
are expected to continue to grow in importance.

Oil & Natural Gas Industry     The interplay
between global politics, world oil supply and demand
and the pace of economic growth worldwide will
remain the key factors in determining future crude oil
prices. Crude oil production capacity will continue to
grow in 1994. Several major OPEC producing coun-
tries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are contin-
uing to boost production capacity. The anticipated 
lifting of the embargo on exports from Iraq was one


of the factors that contributed to the oil price collapse
in late 1993 and is expected to continue to influence 
oil prices. The additional capacity, which includes 
non-OPEC production from areas like Yemen and the 
British North Sea, is continuing to exert downward 
pressure on prices. The extent of that pressure in the
future depends in part upon the ability of OPEC to
maintain production discipline as capacity grows.
These factors could well be counterbalanced by
declines in Russian crude oil exports due to produc-
tion problems and the prospect that the resumption 
of Iraqi exports could be delayed indefinitely. It is
within this geopolitical framework that the NYMEX 
futures market has emerged as a powerful influence
on price as traders react instantaneously based upon 
their perceptions of changing market fundamentals 
and news about global political events.
  The sector of the oil and gas industry that has
attracted the most attention recently and reflects the
most optimistic projections is natural gas. Prices of
natural gas in the United States have moved up 
rapidly and consumption increased in 1993 to over 20
Tcf, the highest level since 1979. The outlook for con-
tinued increases in natural gas demand remains 
highly positive because it is a clean burning, relatively
abundant fuel, making it very attractive in this "age
of environment." It has long been used for residential 
heating and burned under industrial and utility boil-
ers. Now a concerted effort is being made to adapt it
as a transport fuel.
  The United States has large potential reserves of 
natural gas, but drilling activity has been severely 
depressed in recent years. Consequently, proved nat-
ural gas reserves and productive capacity have
declined. With higher prices, companies are resuming
exploration in natural gas-prone areas, and drilling 
activity has started to increase.
  In recent years, structural problems, such as 
government price controls, production and con-
sumption regulations and cumbersome contract
problems, impeded the gas industry's ability to
respond to rapidly changing competitive conditions
and price changes.
  However, the industry recently has made changes
to resolve these problems. Supply contract problems 
are being resolved. The industry is aggressively pursu-
ing its existing markets and expanding into new ones.
Government regulations are being reduced and/or 
eliminated. And of prime importance, natural gas
pricing has become much more flexible and respon-
sive to market changes.
  The anticipated increase in economic activity in
1994 will in turn translate into an increased need for
energy, including natural gas.  In addition to increased
demand for natural gas associated with growing eco-
nomic activity and much colder than normal winter
weather in early 1994, demand also is expected to 
grow due to environmental regulations associated

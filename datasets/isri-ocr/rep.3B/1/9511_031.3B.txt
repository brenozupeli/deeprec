Management's Discussion and Analysis

Earnings
Net income in 1993 was $555 million or $.81 per share, compared
with a loss in 1992 of $3,927 million, or $(5.85) per share.  Results in
1993 include higher restructuring charges, partly offset by reductions
in cost of goods sold; selling, general and administrative expenses;
interest; and other expenses.  1993 results also reflect a lower effec-
tive tax rate in Petroleum operations and a net benefit of $265 million
resulting from tax law changes, primarily in the United Kingdom.
Excluding the 1993 tax benefit, nonrecurring and extraordinary items
from both years, and one-time charges in 1992 for adoption of new
accounting standards, 1993 earnings were $1,677 million, or $2.46
per share, 25 percent higher than the $1,341 million, or $1.98 per
share, earned in 1992.  This improvement reflects higher Petroleum
segment earnings, resulting principally from lower costs and
increased production outside of the United States.  Excluding the coal
business that was adversely affected by United Mine Workers strikes
for most of the year, combined earnings from segments other than
Petroleum also improved, primarily due to cost reductions.

1992 net income* was $975 million, compared to $1,403 million in
1991.  Excluding nonrecurring charges and the after-tax effect of
accounting changes on 1992 earnings, 1992 earnings were $1,698
million, down 2 percent from 1991.  Improvements in the Polymers and
Diversified Businesses segments were offset by lower earnings for
Petroleum.


Taxes

						1993	1992	1991
($ in millions)
	Income tax expense			$ 392	$ 836	$ 1,415
	Effective income tax rate (EITR)	40.9%	46.2%	50.2%


Over the last three years, the company's EITR exceeded the U.S.
statutory rate of 35% in 1993, and 34% in 1992 and 1991, principally
because of the higher tax rates associated with petroleum production
operations outside the United States.  The 1993 EITR decreased about
5 percentage points from the prior year, principally reflecting a lower
effective tax rate in Petroleum operations and the $265 million tax
benefit described above, partly offset by an increased proportion of
higher-taxed Petroleum earnings.  The decrease in the 1992 EITR,
versus 1991, reflected a lower proportion of higher-taxed Petroleum
earnings due to a reduced level of earnings in that segment, partly
offset by an increase in the EITR from adoption of SFAS No. 109.


The company paid total taxes of $6.4 billion in 1993, compared to
$6.6 billion in 1992 and $6.4 billion in 1991.  1993 total tax payments
were lower than 1992 reflecting lower taxes on income.  Tax
payments in 1992 were more than 1991, reflecting higher import
duties and energy taxes outside the United States, partly offset by
lower income tax payments.

CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

During the past three years, cash provided by operations was the
primary source of funding for the company's capital investment
programs and dividends.

Cash provided by operations in 1993 totaled $5.4 billion, $1.0
billion higher than 1992.  This principally reflects higher net income,
excluding restructuring charges, and lower working capital.  The 1993
third-quarter restructuring charge of $1.3 billion after taxes had mini-
mal impact on cash provided by operations in 1993.  Cash provided by
operations in 1992 totaled $4.4 billion, down $1.1 billion from 1991,
principally reflecting lower net income and a smaller benefit from
working capital reductions.

Capital expenditures of $3.7 billion in 1993, including expendi-
tures for investments in affiliates, were $800 million, or 18 percent,
below last year.  Capital expenditures in 1992 were 14 percent lower
than the 1991 level.  The Petroleum segment accounted for 45 percent
of total capital expenditures in 1993, up from 40 percent of the total 
in 1992, reflecting a proportionately higher curtailment of expendi-
tures in segments other than Petroleum.  The most significant
Petroleum expenditures were for development of the Heidrun Field in
Norway, the Murdoch and Alba North fields in the United Kingdom
and the Belida field in Indonesia.  For other segments, capital
spending in 1993 continued to concentrate on strengthening and
growing strategic businesses outside of the United States.  This 
includes projects for "Adi-Pure" adipic acid and "Lycra" spandex in
Singapore, "Ti-Pure" titanium dioxide in Taiwan, and "Nomex"
aramid fibers and THF/"Terathane" polyether glycols in Spain.  In the
United States, significant expenditures were also made for commer-
cialization of CFC alternatives and for modernization of "Dacron"
polyester facilities.  Improvement projects mainly concentrated on
enhancing the efficiency and yields of existing refineries, including
desulfurization of gasoline and diesel fuels, upgrading petroleum
retail marketing networks,  and X-ray film manufacturing.

	Capital expenditures for 1994 are estimated at $3.4 billion.

U.S. Government

The Corporation is now and believes that, in light of the current 
government contracting environment, it will be the subject of one
or more government investigations. If the Corporation or one of its
business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any of 
these investigations, the Corporation or one of its business units
could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new
government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings.
If convicted or found liable, the Corporation could be fined and
debarred from new government contracting for a period generally
not to exceed three years. Any contracts found to be tainted by
fraud could be voided by the Government.
  The Corporation's contracts with the U.S. Government are also
subject to audits. Like many defense contractors, the Corporation
has received audit reports which recommend that certain contract
prices should be reduced to comply with various government regu-
lations. Some of these audit reports involve substantial amounts.
The Corporation has made voluntary refunds in those cases it
believes appropriate.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Corporation uses derivative financial instruments to
manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures in the follow-
ing four areas: foreign currency transactions, foreign net assets,
customer financing assets, and debt. Derivative financial instru-
ments utilized by the Corporation in its foreign currency and
interest rate hedging activities are Over The Counter instruments
and involve little complexity. The Corporation has policies
to monitor the concentration and credit risks of counterparties,
which are a diversified group of major investment grade financial 
institutions.
  International operations, including export sales, constitute a sig-
nificant portion of the revenues and identifiable assets of the Cor-
poration, averaging approximately $11.8 billion and $4.6 billion,
respectively, for each of the last three years. These operations result
in a large volume of foreign currency commitment and transaction
exposures and significant foreign currency net asset exposures. For-
eign currency commitment and transaction exposures are managed
at the operating unit level as an integral part of the business. To the
extent that foreign currency exposures cannot be offset or managed 
to an insignificant amount, it is the Corporation's policy to hedge 
these residual foreign currency commitment and transaction expo-
sures. These hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the


timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and trans-
actions. It has been the Corporation's policy to hedge a portion of
the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associ-
ated with these foreign investments. During 1994 the Corporation
substantially changed this policy and generally will not hedge for-
eign net asset exposures. Certain hedge contracts from the prior 
policy are still outstanding and may be held until their scheduled
maturity.
  The Corporation also has financing assets with commercial air-
line industry customers in connection with engine sale agreements. 
The Corporation may sell customer financing assets from time to 
time based on current market conditions and other factors. To miti-
gate the exposure on certain fixed rate customer financing assets, the
Corporation has entered into interest rate swaps.
  It has been the Corporation's practice to manage the relative
proportions of its fixed rate and floating rate debt in the context of
the interest rate environment, expected cash flow and anticipated 
debt retirements. While the hedging strategies on both debt and 
customer financing assets are an integral portion of the Corpora-
tion's risk management, the impact on earnings during the periods
were not material.

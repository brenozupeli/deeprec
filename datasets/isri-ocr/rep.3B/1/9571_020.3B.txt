Segment Review
1994 Compared to 1993

Otis segment revenues for 1994 increased $226 million (5%)
over 1993. Increased revenues in Asia Pacific and North America
were partially offset by slightly lower revenues in Europe and Latin
America. Revenue increases in Asia Pacific were particularly signifi-
cant during 1994, in part from the increased investment made in 
the People's Republic of China earlier in the year which allowed for
full consolidation. While lower new equipment volumes negatively
affected revenues in Europe and Latin America, the reduction was 
partially offset by higher service revenues. The impact of the transla-
tion of foreign currency revenues into U.S. dollars was a negative 
$19 million for 1994.
  Segment operating profits for Otis in 1994 increased $44 million 
(12%), improving in all regions with the exception of Latin Amer-
ica. Increases in Asia Pacific resulted primarily from the consolida-
tion of the PRC operations and the growth of the Asian market.
European results improved due to the higher service volumes.

Carrier segment revenues for 1994 increased $439 million (10%)
over 1993. Revenues were higher at Carrier Transicold and in all
geographic regions except Europe where volumes were lower. Rev-
enue increases were particularly strong in North America reflecting
the impact of significant volume increases. The impact of the
translation of foreign currency revenues into U.S. dollars was not
significant during 1994.
  Carrier segment operating profits for 1994 increased $52 million
(23%) primarily due to improved results in North America and at
Carrier's Transicold business. Operations in the People's Republic of
China also showed continued strength and accounted for approxi-
mately 15% of Carrier's operating profits over the last three years.

Automotive segment revenues increased $305 million (13%) in 
1994 primarily due to higher North American industry volumes 
and increased European market penetration.
  Automotive segment operating profits for 1994 increased $34
million (23%) over 1993. The increase is primarily attributable to
higher sales volumes and the absence of the 1993 charges to
rationalize certain manufacturing operations in Europe. Partially


offsetting the 1994 increases were higher launch costs in support of
new model awards in North America.

Pratt & Whitney segment revenues for 1994 decreased $471 
million (8%). During 1994, shipments of commercial engines and
sales of government spare parts were lower than those in the previ-
ous year. These reductions during 1994 were partially offset by
higher commercial airline spare parts sales and military engine ship-
ments. Also, the 1993 results included revenues resulting from the
renegotiation of certain aircraft leases.
  Pratt & Whitney segment operating profits increased $194 
million (104%) from 1993. Despite the reduction in revenue, 
Pratt's operating profit increased as a result of the benefits of contin-
uing cost reduction programs, lower research and development 
spending driven by engine certification schedules and higher com-
mercial spare parts sales. The impact of higher manufacturing cost
estimates on commercial engine contracts in the 1994 second quar-
ter, principally related to higher initial production costs on the 
PW4084 engine, partially offset these improvements. In addition,
Pratt & Whitney recorded approximately $50 million of charges
during the second quarter of 1994 for certain volume related down-
sizing actions.

Flight Systems segment revenues for 1994 decreased $337 million
(10%) from 1993. Excluding the 1994 second quarter gain on
the sale of the equity share holdings in Westland Group plc, seg-
ment revenues decreased $424 million (12%) from 1993. Revenues 
decreased primarily as a result of lower international helicopter
shipments at Sikorsky, continuing reductions in commercial aero-
space volumes at Hamilton Standard, and the absence of Norden
revenues after its sale in May 1994.
  Flight Systems operating profits decreased $73 million (21%)
in 1994. Excluding the gain on the equity share holdings in West-
land Group plc, segment operating profits decreased $160 million
(45%) from 1993. Operating profits decreased primarily as a result
of higher costs associated with the introduction of new products
and continuing lower commercial aerospace volumes at Hamilton
Standard, and the absence of Norden results. In addition, Hamilton 
Standard recorded approximately $35 million of charges during the
second quarter of 1994 for certain volume related downsizing
actions.
